# Discussion:

**Starting a discussion about in3s validator.** When i was new in the staking (I am still lol) I was exploring the validators and stopped at this one. It has all qualities: low commission (not zero), active, [**restake.app**](https://restake.app), and good Self Bond (now it's reduced to 1? ATOM but it wasn't).

It's actually perfect but.. i was just wondering why there is no any information about them. Website is single page, no twitter, no telegram, no discord, etc.

P.S.: I didn't inspect their proposal votes yet but I understand that this is very important to consider where to delegate!

Say destroying an opponent gives you some of their held balance, then if the game server can be cheated, what's the advantage of that blockchain..

"Some thoughts on how we should structure the Hub treasury going forward. SubDAOs and sovereign treasury entities could help clean up some of the inefficiencies.","Jcook_14","2023-03-05 13:05:43","***This is actually a response I made to a posts on the Forum, but I will clarify some items at the end to help with some additional context.***

Link to the Hub forum discussion- https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposals-requesting-community-funds-should-have-a-higher-pass-threshold-and-quorum/10046

The Hub really needs a plan of action when it comes to treasury governance. Personally, I don‚Äôt think we necessarily need to change voting, I think we need to divvy out to multiple different subDAO‚Äôs as well as grant programs similar to the Accelerator DAO (for more business development types of funding).

These subDAO‚Äôs could be structured different in terms of Governance with different levels of decentralization and separate mandates, to what their funding should go towards. However, the point is, the decentralized funding option we have now, is not efficient enough to do what we need it to do, in a reasonable amount of time. So we should probably come to some level of agreement on what our treasury needs to look like.

I like the seperate subDAO, grant fund models, where these entities can come back and request more money from the treasury if they need a refill. This holds the entitity accountable to the decentralized Governance of the Hub, while still allowing it to have some level of sovereign control over the funds, after they have received the ATOMs.

Then we don‚Äôt have to change governance drastically for treasury requests, we can create these organizations and the multisigs can be with trusted community members, who can be voted in and out of the subDAO multisig, if deemed necessary by the governance structure of the subDAO (could be the community, or it could be the other multisig members in a more centralized entity like the accelerator DAO).

This would require work, creating these subDAOs. The creation of each subDAO and its Governance structure, would need to go through a formal approval from delegators. However, I believe this could be a good structure that relieves the Hub‚Äôs governance of constant funding proposals, while still retaining a decentralized treasury system. With this treasury being ultimately accountable to voters.

The Accelerator DAO, while I disagreed with the amount given (in terms of initial funding), I believe they had a good idea and we need to come up with some plans on how we should divvy out some treasury funding to entities that can provide value to the Hub. Because ultimately, the Hub will be left behind if we can‚Äôt get a few more, less political funding operations going

***I want to clarify, that in these subDAOs, they won‚Äôt be ‚Äúofficial‚Äù treasury subDAOs necessarily. They are just separate entities, that can have varying governance structures and mandates, that are ultimately held accountable to Hub delegators, for the actual funds. But their intention is to remove treasury drama and the frequency of treasury requests. Funds come at the whim of the Hubs delegators, so if we as delegators feel the subDAO or grant fund program, isn‚Äôt doing well, we can cut their funding or claw it back, depending on the situation.***

***I would love to hear opinions on this subject as I know some in the community don‚Äôt like the idea of subDAOs or grant funds helping to filter out requests, and ultimately controlling the Hubs funding operations. But i think we can form some agreement, that the Hub is very inefficient as it is, so we need to figure something out.***","7","[""Perhaps it would be more efficient to have a transparent proposal committee with 1 or several paid positions, if it were unpaid the job done by the committee is either going to be corrupt and that makes it worthless or there will be very little incentive for the committee members to sink significant research time into worthwhile proposals.\n\nPerhaps there could be several different committees that fulfill different proposal genres for example but not limited to: Chain upgrades, new growth opportunities, charity, new committees could be formed if more or future genres really seem like they need to exist. The committees rather than having a purse to spend that the delegators have no direct say in, could vet proposals for the likelihood they are fraud/not fraud and a proposal that gains a committee stamp of approval for not being obvious fraud could appear as a \""pinned\"" style proposal in the governance section of voting. Governance is absolutely atrocious and full of scams at this very minute, there are hundreds of bait scams to rob you. This change could help alleviate that problem.\n\nAdditionally, this would keep the funds to be created/distributed in the control of the voters where it really should be, but would also give a fleshed out opinion on worthwhile proposals. This opinion doesn't mean vote yes, it means this proposal is actually worth your effort as an individual to learn more about and to form your own opinion and vote on the matter as you see fit.\n\nThe committees could simply reject fraud proposals by not allowing their stamp, these proposals could obviously still be put up for voting, but over time if the committees do a good job their stamp of worthiness will carry significant weight as to whether or not a delegator should spend some time learning about and voting on a proposal. At the moment one of the most significant issues impacting the Cosmos is that the majority of proposals are either obvious fraud, not so obvious fraud but still fraud, or extremely arcane. It would be very important that the committee members reports and all materials used were public for anyone who cared to dig through, and that committee members could be replaced/recalled if they aren't doing a good job. It is also extremely important that the committee members are ONLY delegators, and are in no way shape or form representing a validator or a developer or anyone else that could be perceived as significant in the governance structure/clout.  The people can only trust the people.\n\nI am not a fan of creating a pot of money that a few people get to spend as they see fit. I am a fan of creating a small committee that recommend proposals as being worthy of you looking into whether or not the voters themselves should even bother spending the time learning about the proposal to vote yes/no to generate quorum. With this committee and pinning system (and research materials in addendum) we will be able to easily filter out the spam and fraud, while still allowing grass roots proposals that the committee misses to prove themselves their own way. There have been 136 proposals submitted since the beginning of march, It's been 4 days.  Most of these will not make it to the voting period, but even the ones that do include obvious grifts and fraud, there may be some worthwhile proposals in there too, but as an average cosmos staker its tough to know which ones are worth devoting any time toward. A committee's stamp of approval could raise future delegator governance participation significantly. If we want the community to not only grow, but also thrive, we need to increase governance participation in addition to growing the infrastructure and application side.\n\nI'm not sure what would be fair for this type of position to pay, obviously it would pay in atoms. If the cosmos grows into what I think it will be in the future, it will need to eventually turn into a set of full time salary positions. As we stand now, it can probably be covered with only part time pay/commitment. As the cosmos grows, the number of potentially significant proposals will grow as well.

"Quicksilver/QCK not yet airdropped, cant be bought yet, BUT keplr validators already hold them. how is that possible?","Meggi-Online","2023-03-05 10:02:40","&amp;#x200B;

hi -

i like to understand this. under:

[https://wallet.keplr.app/chains/quicksilver](https://wallet.keplr.app/chains/quicksilver)

it can be seen that QCKs are already in some hands.. are those validator getting rewards, too?

and why do they have different amounts? i mean, who decides who gets what before the public could buy QCK?

and another question.. under:

[https://medium.com/quicksilverzone/airdrop-wen-3eb649784f90](https://medium.com/quicksilverzone/airdrop-wen-3eb649784f90)

it stats that 100 000 000 QCK get at the start into the airdrop. but when you count all validator coins, you get already to a high number..i stopped at 40 000 000. what are those? are those part of the airdrop sum?

do validator have to buy those OTC? or is it ""their"" airdrop predropped? i thought validators get their coins from users staking with them.

if someone has answers, please share. thank you!

\------------------------------------edit\*              thank you community! a lot answered!","27","[""The Validators are \""Genesis Validators\"" I'm not sure how they were chosen. QuickSilver dished out those tokens to the Genesis Validators to secure the chain and get things rolling. So QuickSilver is the one staking those tokens. It's like when Cosmos Hub makes delegations to select validators, Cosmos Hub is staking those tokens, but the validators are awarded those delegations."",""Hey there. So I am a validator in cosmos and can properly answer this. Validators are selected by the network based kn their reputation and previous work. Usually network chase chose validators or the other way around, validators might chase some network and contribute to get a genesis place. The network will then delegate a specific amount of tokens to these to protect and launch the network. Usually they run more delegation programs in the future and pick other validators in the process (ICF just did that on cosmos hub recently). \n\nThose validators getting these genesis will be best placed overall because they will generate more commission rewards and better place themselves so it's super important for a validator to be genesis.\n\nAlso there are private sales etc for VCs but that can happen after launch too. As an example Evmos just did that. Problem with doing this is that the majority of VCs will use this tokens to self stake on their own validarors and daily dump the rewards on the market which can make a little pressure on the selling vs buying and disrupt the token price. \n\nIn this case quicksilver ran a serie of polls for the community to select their favourite validators so they could be awarded as a genesis validator.\n\nHopefully this was insightful, I am one of the founders of Tedcrypto, we validate evmos, juno, mars etc. \n\nQuestions ?

These guys are asking for 3000$/person/month to moderate a Discord and Telegram channels for Secret Network. This work is part-time, and they will dedicate 20h each week to it.  


Yet another scam on the Cosmos Ecosystem where people try to drain funds that are supposed to support development for the chain, not to massively overpay internet moderators.

Generally because there's no meaningful way to know for sure that the $$$ is going where they say it'll go. If we figure that out, I'm more likely to vote. The hub absolutely needs to use community funds for the betterment of the chain and it's community, I just want more transparency and communication. \nI'm conflicted with the 103/104 props, the folks contribute a bunch, but confio case, they're allegedly tied up partyly by NDA's so they cant speak freely, but they have been adding to the cosmwasm stack plenty throughout the yrs and I'd like to see them continue more, I just wanna know they're not burning through cash irresponsibly.

The community funds purpose is to build out the network, and there are valid proposals to do this. We voted to raise the pool level for this very purpose and to provide the hub block grant resources to lure development rather than having to vote on every single item. It's harder to get a developer involved when we can't even guarantee a project.\n\nThat being said, Atom is not a charity network, and I felt the Notional ask (while I'm aware he has done positive work for the chain being a relayer) was a bit much. Confio and spacebox are 2 I voted yes too because they tie to development of our software libraries which is important. \n\nAll I'm asking this community to consider is that to grow any business (I have some background here), you need to invest and develop resources to grow.

While you're right in a general sense, it's not in entirety.

This is something the cosmos needs and that everyone will benefit from. While we are aiming to be profitable in time, it's not so that we can get rich, but rather so that we can keep providing what we provide WITHOUT having to ask for community funds over an over again.  \n\n\nI personally think we've found the nice middle ground.

In this Repository, they state that they have paused integration with Replicated Security, due to uncertainty around the removal of automated slashing packets to the Hubs validator set. At inception, Noble will utilize a small, permissioned set of Validators, with fees generated from activity on the chain, being used to pay the validator set. 

This does not mean that, Noble will not be a consumer chain at some point. Assuming automated slashing packets get utilized in a later upgrades to ICS, they may choose to onboard as well. But this first iteration, relies on social slashing mechanics, throttles and queues, as safety features, due to risks of malicious consumer chain code sending slashing packets causing mass slashing events on the Cosmos Hub. This is also a reason that Consumer code will need audited and heavily scrutinized, before it is used for running a consumer chain. 

At the moment, this a pretty fair hit to ICS and the Hub. A lot of people looked forward to Noble and a Circle native asset issuance chain paying fees to ATOM stakers. Let‚Äôs just hope we get automated slashing functions in ICS reasonably soon, and hope that this doesn‚Äôt deter other chains from releasing on ICS as well.","9","[""Glad that they are still launching.

"Cosmos IBC and Interchain Security. Brief overview","Jcook_14","2023-02-28 23:50:04","*Repost of my post on r/cryptocurrency, tried to keep it short and sweet.*

***The IBC*** 

Interblockchain Communication protocol. This protocol allows sovereign blockchains that are hooked into it, to communicate freely. This includes but is not limited to coin transfers, but also arbitrary data, and thanks to Interchain Accounts and Interchain Queries, it also includes cross chain smart contract deployment and execution.

The IBC is a seriously impressive piece of technology, and groundbreaking in the age of interoperability. Retaining sovereignty in your blockchain is necessary for many projects and it why projects like Near, and DYDX are choosing to join the IBC. I‚Äôve heard that Solana has a layer 2 being built that will also connect to the IBC. Composable is bringing both Near and Polkadot to the IBC. ATOM Dev, Jack Zampolin is also in talks with core Algorand Devs as well to connect to the IBC. Landslide, which is a Avalanche subnet, is bringing a connection for Avalanche, to the IBC. World Mobile is bringing an IBC connection to Cardano.

Simply put, IBC has gain traction because of a few simple concepts. Retain your sovereignty and creative edge in your chain, pay fees to cross to new chains, in your native token. Maximum freedom, maximum value via fees paid natively. 

*Interchain Security: this feature of the Cosmos Hub, has the potential to change ATOM into one of, if not the best dividend paying in crypto.*

***What is Interchain Security?***
 
Interchain Security allows for new or existing blockchains, to skip the line of finding validators and let‚Äôs them hook into the existing ATOM validator set. This means that projects can retain sovereignty, have fees on chain paid in their native currency AND lease security from a nearly $4 billion dollar blockchain. What does it take from the protocol being added? The chain has to be approved via ATOM Governance. 

In this approval process they need to show as much info as possible to ensure this addition to the validator set will be worth the extra work a validator will have to do. But while this provides more work, it could show even more profit for ATOM validators and stakers. 

The reason this is so bullish is that these chains that lease ATOMs validator set, will be paying the ATOM validators and stakers in their native currency. Or they can also be paying in any fee token, that the consumer chain utilizes (so this could mean ATOM or another IBC native currency, could be used rather than the consumer chain having its own token). This additional yield will be on top of the staking rewards from ATOM (23% at time of writing). What happens when 5-10 chains are paying ATOM validators? Let‚Äôs hope for good things!

Abstain makes sense here since there is a direct conflict of interest. Abstain is a necessary vote option in some cases, but if a validator is just voting abstain on every proposal then I'd suggest redelegating."",""Validators voting power needs to have limits placed on it. We have seen several times now where a validator with an outsized influence swings a vote at the last second. 75% of the community voted no or abstain on prop 101 but it passed with just 23% support. That's not right."",""One vote one point, and that for everyone whether validator or sta. Who thought up this nonsense again"",""Hahahahaha that would be the worst thing to do. You‚Äôd have to have a completely separate vote for everyone involved for each specific validator. The point of staking is to secure the network, leaving the major decisions to the  community and people with separate tokens to vote.

Abstention is a valid form of manifestion your opinion, such as neutrality towards outcome or mild annoyance without active opposition (like a \""I rather not, but oh well\""). Not everything in life is a yes or no question and remaining neutral or indifferent (bowing to the will of the remainders, as you hold no clear position) is a rightful decision.\n\nI also agree that you can be an ethical non-voter in certain subjects, which would be out of reach without an abstain vote. You could also assign an effect to abstention - such as a repeat or small redesign of the proposal (addressing small concerns) if it's higher than the \""yes\"".\n\nIf the second, I agree, voting should always be mandatory for validators - with abstain being an option of vote.""]"

"We need to start voting NO WITH VETO to send a message to groups intending to drain funds","DontTickleMeow","2023-02-28 04:32:01","All around the Cosmos Ecosystem we're seeing governance proposals that intend drain the community pool funds, sometimes even for personal profit.  


In Cosmos, the latest examples are the Turkey donation proposal #101 and the current Information webpage proposal #202.  
Proposal #101 (Turkey) is downright a misuse of community funds and bypassed a basic rule of governance, which is giving time for stakers to read and comment the proposal before it is submitted for voting on governance. The proposers even aknowledge this and their excuse for that behaviour is that other catastrophe donations should go through a CharityDAO, but not theirs. They don't even consider that they misused the funds that were allocated to the growth of Cosmos. Don't expect any news headlines from this donation, and it wouldn't surprise me if the proposers did the donation to an NGO as a tax write off.  
Proposal #202 (Information webpage) is the typical way to dry the pool. A good proposal on paper that's asking for too much money for what they are providing. Also, there's not going to be any accountability from their part so, if the project does not go to completion, don't expect any funds to be returned to the community pool.

  
By voting NO, we're giving this groups the sensation that they can keep making dumb proposals with no consequences. If the proposal is denied, they will recover their deposit and use that deposit to try again and again until one of their proposals can fool enough people to get what they want.  


**We need to start voting NO WITH VETO** to proposals that intend to get too many funds in exchange for very little (or downright nothing), or that have no manner for delegators to make them accountable if they don't deliver what they promised.

Even proposals with little support, eg &lt;20% yes votes, can pass because &gt;55%+ voted abstain.

"‚öõÔ∏èCommunity Feedback on Replicated Security","ZoltanAtom","2023-02-27 19:30:21","**‚öõÔ∏èReplicated Security is a much-awaited Cosmos Hub feature!**

üèõÔ∏èComing with the Lambda Upgrade, currently in voting period.

*üéØConsidering the importance of this upgrade for ATOM future...*

üß©Today‚Äôs thread will address community feedback, starting with Validator Cost &amp; Slashing

* Validators will need to run all consumer chains that are approved by governance or face downtime slashing. This is essential to preserve the high-security properties of Replicated Security.  Some are concerned about the cost of running additional consumer chains.
* [@informalinc](https://twitter.com/informalinc), the team leading the development of replicated security are taking several steps to address validator costs:  First, consumer chains will set their downtime window to 3+ days, meaning that validators can be down for a long time before receiving a downtime jail.
* This solution will reduce the risk of jailing, the increased leniency means that validators can run consumer chains with less redundancy, cutting costs. This will not pose a problem for the reliability of consumer chains.
* Second, [@informalinc](https://twitter.com/informalinc) will help the first consumer chain teams prepare financial projections quantifying the rewards that can be expected by the validators and delegators of the Cosmos Hub. This will help the community decide whether a given consumer chain is worth approving.
* Some community members were concerned that a malicious consumer chain could send falsified slashing packets to the Hub, causing validators to be slashed unfairly. This is one of the main reasons that consumer chains need to be audited before the governance proposal.
* Although this scenario is very unlikely, it is a valid concern and additional protection is already implemented through a throttling mechanism to slow down the slashing process to allow time to stop this attack.
* To make things even safer, changes have been made so that slashes for double signing (the most serious type of consensus offense with the highest punishment) need to go through one additional step of being approved by governance.

&gt;*This will provide extra safety in the early stages of Replicated Security‚Äôs launch.  More information regarding this measure can be found in the Cosmos Hub Forum:* [*HERE*](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/slashing-updates-in-replicated-security/9571)  
&gt;  
&gt;*And in the following blog post:* [*HERE*](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing)

* The teams working on the Hub are listening to community feedback and prioritizing security to make sure that the launch of Replicated Security will be a success!   This is the dawn of a new era of development around the [\#ATOM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATOM?src=hashtag_click) ‚öõÔ∏è

What could encourage good Governance? I‚Äôm toying with an additional concept, that tags along with the Sovereign Cosmos Hub Governance chain idea, and how we could encourage good Governance instead of the spam or incoherent, unproductive props we sometimes have in the Cosmos. 

(This was a part of a previous thought experiment, but there doesn‚Äôt need to be a seperate governance chain, rather simply a seperate Hub of governance . This Hub would be somewhat of a social media of governance with deposit functionality to act as a governance gate to on-chain governance. This could be treasury specific governance gating as well, if that is a more logistically appealing method, to not slow down or impede on other types of governance proposals. Further details behind how this governance gating for on-chain governance could work are below.)

**This idea has a few key concepts**:

1. A central Hub governance site, with its own on-chain governance system. This would effectively be the governance gate to on-chain proposals for the Cosmos Hub. (similar to Commonwealth but, in this case, Cosmos Hub specific and with additional functionality.)

2. The deposit of a Governance proposal to be raised significantly. I‚Äôll say .0005% of the total supply which as of today would be around 1,500 ATOMs. Delegators will be allowed to easily deposit tokens to crowdfund proposals to become active on chain proposals. Further explanation into why such a significant raise later in the post.

This functionality could be implemented in other similar ways as well. An example being, rather than a deposit, delegators could dedicate a specific amount of their current stake to a proposal they want to see implemented that has been proposed on the Governance Hub. This would be an amount they are willing to have slashed, if the proposal is a No with Veto in the on-chain governance voting period. On the flip side, this could reward them with additional incentives, if the proposal passes.

3. The ability to incentivize delegators to take an active role in Governance, by encouraging and empowering good Governance and productive proposals. Being active in Governance should be rewarded for delegators in some capacity, otherwise we will continue to have low quality Governance and spam proposals. (This could come from an incentive token, rather than ATOM. Incentive distribution would come after a proposal passes on-chain.)

4. An automatic 1% slashing penalty for the deposit of a ‚ÄúNo with veto‚Äù proposal. This could limit the willingness of depositors and proposal issuers alike, to send out spam, incoherent or simple money grab proposals.

**Explanation of the various Governance processes and concepts**

*Central Hub of Governance*:

* The Governance process would have to shift away from Commonwealth, and move to a central hub, built to interact with the Cosmos Hub and the Governance Chain. This hub would have to have a few key characteristics that are monitored and in many cases, will trigger a reactionary execution by the Cosmos Hub or the Governance Hub.

This hub would require that in order for any proposal to be listed on chain, the final draft of the proposal should be listed on the Governance Hub. The reason you want the final draft to be on the hub, is because it will be going on chain if it receives a sufficient amount of deposits, and if there is a chance that the deposits could be slashed or incentivized (touched on in the incentives and slash explanation later in the post), you probably want the highest level of proposal you can have, being deposited into.

*Deposit Raised Significantly*:

* The next concept is the drastic addition to the deposit amount required to allow a prop to be listed on-chain. The amount will be a fixed rate (modifiable by governance), like the current 64 ATOM deposit amount. But it will go up to 1,500 ATOMs. This is a far larger amount than the current deposit, but the crowd funding aspect of the governance Hub should make it far more doable, so long as the proposal is generally meaningful to the Cosmos Hub. 

Before posting a proposal, they will want to create a meaningful proposal with the backing of the community, to create the highest likelihood that the proposal get posted on chain and also passes, as to not have the deposit get slashed (will be explained in further detail in the last explanation).

- In regards to the deposit, you will earn incentives and your deposit will be returned if the prop is accepted on-chain, and the proposal passes. 

- If the proposal meets deposit requirements and gets put on chain, but is voted No,  deposit then the deposit is returned. 

- If the deposit is accepted on chain, and fails as No with Veto the deposit funds are slashed and the remaining amount is returned. 

***This line of thinking could still remain the same, if there is no deposit, but rather staked tokens are being dedicated to a specific prop. These tokens can still earn incentives, if the proposal passes on chain, but could still be slashed if the vote is No with Veto on chain.***

*Incentives for Good Governance*:

* In order to encourage good Governance, we may not be able to rely on one‚Äôs ‚Äúcivic duty‚Äù to be the most encouraging model. What if there was an incentive model to reward good Governance, just as there is an incentive to not deposit into unreasonable proposals? I see this in the same light of incentive structure as, Validators running the chain in a truthful manner to get block rewards but if they commit an act on chain that the network doesn‚Äôt approve of, they will be slashed and jailed.

Delegators can be encouraged to create good governance, pay attention to governance and produce better proposals on-chain, with incentives that execute after a proposal has passed. I see this as a potential function that could lead to delegators wanting to take a more active role in governance and paying attention mroe in governance, and with Interchain Security making it more important than ever for delegator participation and attention, incentives may be a good motive for delegators staying attentive and active.

***Slashing*** : 

Slashing or perhaps, the threat of being slashed, is an important function of validating. If you misbehave you get slashed. Blockchains can‚Äôt afford mistakes, or wasted block producers. They need trustworthy Validators, who don‚Äôt make attempts to mislead the network. Delegators should also be held to this standard in the face of important network activities.

So, the way I see delegators in this model of slashing is very similar to how I viewed the incentive structure but with reversed roles. If you deposit into a proposal, and that proposal fails (no with veto or not meeting quorum), the deposit on the Governance Hub will be slashed.

Obviously, some proposals will not pass, and controversial proposals shouldn‚Äôt always be punished, so there is a necessary discussion to have around just how far these slashing events should take place, or if these slashing events should be a social slashing event. So I‚Äôm open to various ideas on this slashing subject, as this idea would need ironed out significantly in terms of the most effective yet fair way to slash. Ideas and criticisms of this are welcome!

**Conclusion**:

Blockchains tend to lack good, productive or meaningful Governance. While I do believe the Cosmos Hub has the best version of on-chain Governance, spam and time wasting proposals find their way into Governance frequently. These wasteful proposals waste time and blockspace. They waste the time of the community and they waste the gas to No with Veto them. This means to me, we could find a better, more efficient system to handling Governance and the proposal process.

I found the idea of incentive's in a Governance system as well as slashing functions, to be a pretty interesting thought experiment and I think it could provide deep value to use this as a tool for better Governance. Whether this happens in the way I have envisioned it, or a totally new and better way, the idea behind incentivized Governance could hold weight as a meaningful way to help promote a healthier and more efficient Governance structure.

Also increasing minimum deposit amount to at least 1 atom.\n\nAs for your idea as far as i understand you want to have like on chain site that will have function to use staked assets for proposal if i understand correctly?

""The Interchain Foundation (ICF) has announced the first cycle of delegations under their new Delegations Policy, which aims to empower, recognize, and reward valuable contributions who contribute to the growth and success of the Interchain. The program is designed to provide a long-term, sustainable solution that fairly shares value with contributors. The ICF has announced the 93 validators selected for the first cycle of ATOM delegations, showcasing the collaborative and democratic nature of the Interchain Foundation. The new delegations policy will ensure that validators are empowered and fairly recognized for their contributions to Interchain's growth and success.""

Would love a dumbed down version of it but my initial questions are,
1. How frequent are they and is it a luck based acquisition?
2. Does more atom=more airdrops?
3. Does diversifying your validators increase your odds? I have several hundred Atom, should I leave them in a few or if I disperse amongst?
4. Do any validators have a better chance?
5. Is it even worth it to care? I collect CDC diamonds and it‚Äôs fun but in reality it‚Äôs a waste of time since it‚Äôs Pennie‚Äôs.

That‚Äôs crew!

Edit: I am getting a significant number of DMs about this but no one is commenting. Is this a taboo topic because I feel like more people would like this information.","14","[""The dms are scams block and don‚Äôt open.\nNot a lot of answers because this is asked about 3x a week it seems. However I had most these questions when I started so I give you my answers.\n\n1. How often? nobody knows was a lot more during bull run but that makes sense they normally announce it after the snapshot date. Perosnal guess about 3-6 good drops a yr 1-5 ahh ok it free money don‚Äôt complain drops and about 2-8 pos 99.9% chance they will be complete garbage. not luck based at all it just how long have u had them staked in most cases seems about a 6 month trailing snapshot seems normal some quicker some longer\n2.in most cases yes more atom = more drops not always some are fair drops(everybody gets same amount no matter how much atom they had) fair drops normally suck but sometimes u catch a good one. Your more likely to not have enough staked then too much some cap their airdrops at 50k atom ( hell of a problem to have to many atom) most suggest having at least 25 atom staked to qualify for most airdrops I would suggest at least 50 atom and 100 would most likely get u decent drops.\n3. Not really it‚Äôs a good idea to spread it around to 2-5 validators just in case one gets slashed but unless u pick a cex validator or a top 10 one normally won‚Äôt matter you‚Äôll get most real drops. \n4. No besides don‚Äôt use a cex one. Stop thinking of it as a chance it‚Äôs not. if u have required amount staked you‚Äôll get it. Airdrops are not lottery‚Äôs and any airdrop that was I would stay the f away from it.\n5 yes and no during bull runs and even some during this bear have been decent plenty of $20, $100 worth drops for only having like $500 invested in atom at the time. Others are junk at time of drop and still are but you could have got like .50 worth off pretty much any drop. I also collect diamonds cuz why not and it‚Äôs nothing like that garbage.\n\nIt should be noted other coins in this ecosystem are also sometimes given airdrops depending on the drop and what dapp it will be used on. Used to be ATOM, OSMO, and JUNO were kinda of the big 3 that got you most. Now I think juno is kinda of off that list and maybe u want starz (NFT thing not my cup of tea but alot mention this one) or evmos (also not my personal jam but might be good for future drops).\nAll that said if u got like 5 atom staked that‚Äôs an awesome start but don‚Äôt expect money to fall out of sky that probably won‚Äôt get u shit for airdrops. GL keplr is the way to go."",""Check out cosmos pug to keep track of the drops. I won't put the link just in case but it's easy to find. They are sporadic and more infrequent since the downturn. For reference, I got a good size evmos airdrop with much less staked than what you have and at one point it was worth over 1k after continually compounding rewards. Its much less now but for a while , I was converting rewards to atom and accumulated about 30 atom from evmos rewards alone. As far as vaildators go, often times top 10 or 20 validators are excluded and exchange validators like coinbase are always excluded. There is also a sub reddit for drops. R/cosmosairdrops"",""All your questions could easily be answered by using a search engine. I know it, because a year ago I had the same questions. \n\nAs for the airdrops in general, I give you the advice to save time and energy by not going after them. Airdrops have become extremely unreliable and are often connected to stupid tasks like twitter posts or friend tagging. Most of them are shit coins anyways and the few cents are not even worth claiming them. Better spend your time in learning TA or reading crypto news, it pays much more."",""Hi buddy\r  \n\r  \n1. Drops are not cyclically needed payouts on sites when airdrops are to be collected\r  \nExamples:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://airdrop.glideapp.io/dl/d0a5f4\r  \n\r  \nhttps://airdrops.one/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://cosmospug.com/\r  \n\r  \n2. As you wrote, the more Atom, the more drops, but there are other coins for which there are drops and nice shown on the page\r  \nhttps://cosmospug.com/\r  \n\r  \n3. There is a possibility for validators by throwing them into a few or into a validator from which you can get a dump, but I still recommend diversifying and considering validators below the first 10 with the charge and not recognizing validators from Cex. Let's build decentralization\r  \n\r  \n4. I don't know about the CDC and my community and I invest in many places\r  \n\r  \nbest to read the whitepaper and include conclusions if it has any overview\r  \n\r  \nIf my answers aren't entirely clear, ask the question again and we'll figure something out""]"

"What is ICS and why Replicated Security is important for Cosmos Hub? ‚öõÔ∏è","bro_n_bro","2023-02-24 02:54:24","ICS (Interchain Security) is a family of protocols designed to provide security and interoperability between different blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem, while Replicated Security is a specific feature within ICS that allows the Cosmos Hub to extend its strong security to other blockchains, called consumer chains ‚õìÔ∏è

This allows consumer chains to benefit from the Cosmos Hub‚Äôs validator set without having to maintain their own, while also enabling the Hub to validate multiple chains at once with the same stake. In exchange, consumer chains are expected to share a portion of their fees and inflation with Cosmos Hub validators and delegators üí∏

ICS benefits

* enhanced reliability and faster recovery in case of security breach or failure
* simplified maintenance and reduced costs with minimal manual updates
* improved security posture through consistent security configurations
* easier compliance with regulatory requirements with a standard security baseline

ICS downsides

* increased complexity - making it more difficult to manage
* increased cost - due to the need for additional hardware
* sync issues - if updates or changes need to be made
* false sense of security - may create a lack of attention to security risks

So while replicated security provides extra layer of protection, it should not be considered as a replacement for other security measures üîß","14","[""You should post this on the r/cryptocurrency sub.

"Everstake releases a report on ATOM staking featuring on-chain data analysis for 2020-2022","Vad1m-Everstake","2023-02-24 02:18:01","We are excited to present exclusive staking report on ATOM prepared by [Everstake](https://everstake.one/) validator. It‚Äôs the first report using data from our analytics tools, Slurp and Staking API.

[ATOM staking report](https://preview.redd.it/gcr5nmb71zja1.png?width=1307&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=05393879700b95edb71f02f1c3450bd4a296f46a)

The problem is that most data resources track only APR, the number of validators, price, and block time. Still, this data set is often insufficient, so Everstake‚Äôs engineers had to develop their own research tools to learn more about blockchain metrics.

Staking, delegation, transaction validation, block creation, and reward accrual happen on-chain, which means that all transactions are recorded in the blockchain and are readable. 

Slurp collects this data and transforms it for further analysis. We chose Cosmos (ATOM) for our first Staking Report as it implements an adaptive inflation mechanism depending on the ratio of total stake to the whole ATOM token supply. This makes it a valuable subject in the research of validator and delegator behavior and in identifying correlations. 

Read the report to learn the dynamics of the staked ratio, inflation, APY, and more in 2020-2022. It also extensively discusses stake distribution between top validators, delegators‚Äô distribution between top validators, restake rewards ratios, and much more. Find the report here:

Today I wanted to move 3 ATOM from my Defi APP ([Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)) to my LEDGER, because I wanted to keep them SAFU. I am not a new user. I did the same steps i am used to. i went on ledger live, pressed on ""Receive"" and i scanned the QR code with my phone.

Usually atom is a fast chain, in a couple minutes arrives.

The operation was completed on my defi APP, but i didn't recive anything in my Ledger. 10 min pass, nothing. 20 minutes? zero and I start to got worried. so I went in MINTSCAN and I searched the ID of transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qxmbv9xahoja1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=be5907a78bc5264b5e07068b03b3b0993824b4b4

This post was created to address the growing discussion about key management, **VaaS**, and related topics within the **Cosmos** community. Unfortunately, there have been many confusing and misleading statements made over the past few weeks, often due to a lack of knowledge or a clear misunderstanding of these complex topics. In order to prevent further damage to the community or our company‚Äôs reputation, we have decided to clarify some of these important concepts. We believe that educating ourselves and others is crucial to avoiding misunderstandings and making well-informed decisions that benefit the community.

# VaaS and key management.

This is by far the most active and also controversial topic that we have found and by far the most error-prone and requires basic, yet **accurate** knowledge.

# What is VaaS?

**VaaS** stands for ‚Äú**Validator as a Service**‚Äù, another term is white label solution. It is a service that provides users with access to a pre-configured validator node on a blockchain. **VaaS** providers allow users to participate in the network without having to set up and maintain their own validator node, which can be very complex and resource-intensive. **VaaS** providers typically offer a range of services, such as automatic upgrades, monitoring, security, and backup, to ensure that the validator node operates reliably and securely. **Allnodes** is one of numerous **VaaS** providers, and to be honest, not the largest in the **Cosmos** ecosystem (**Terra Classic** is an outlier due to its unique circumstances).

# But if you run my node for me doesn‚Äôt that mean you have my keys?

To answer the question of whether a **VaaS** provider has access to a user‚Äôs private keys, it‚Äôs necessary to understand some important terms. Let‚Äôs start with the basic terminology.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**1. Validator‚Äôs private key**

The private key of the validator node (not to be confused with the mnemonic/seed phrase) is a critical component of its functionality, and **VaaS** services require access to this key in order to run the node. In other words, if an individual or institution, such as a bank or hedge fund, wants to avoid the complexity of setting up the infrastructure and learn to master Linux to spin up a node, they must be willing to share the key with a VaaS provider. No **VaaS** provider on any **Cosmos** blockchain can operate in a different way. It‚Äôs important to note that this key has no monetary value and does not provide access to the customer‚Äôs funds. To reiterate, its sole purpose is to sign blocks on the network.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**2. Owner address mnemonic**

The owner address mnemonic (seed phrase) is used to activate a node, participate in governance, and manage the node. It is not uncommon for services in the **VaaS** industry to have access to this mnemonic. Furthermore, upon our research, we learned that some services may even refuse to provide this key to the customer upon request.

It‚Äôs important to emphasize that we at **Allnodes** DO NOT possess this key for all of our customers that initiated their **Tendermint-based** nodes through our new non-custodial node-management system launched on **January 27**th.  


[Proof \(Jan 27, 2023\): https:\/\/twitter.com\/allnodes\/status\/1619015621727125509](https://preview.redd.it/dd0xhccchoja1.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=829f12d3d359dc7d94fecac91645132c10927fb7)

This platform has a user-friendly interface with buttons that link to all of the node management functions. The main reason for developing this system was to increase the security of the network by eliminating the need to store or access the mnemonic, given its critical functions. It also allows us to reduce the manual work involved in situations where the key owner needs to change certain parameters of the node like adjusting commission fees.  


[Proof \(Jan 27, 2023\): https:\/\/twitter.com\/allnodes\/status\/1619015679876956161](https://preview.redd.it/dl9ckxuchoja1.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7f10a1c09102ce1541c96a2f0fa24b31f21a1c81)

We are confident that **Allnodes** is one of the very few **VaaS** providers to offer a convenient non-custodial (in terms of the owner address) method for launching and maintaining **Tendermint-based** nodes.

Additionally, for customers who launched their node with us prior to **January 27**, **2023**, we offer the option to either remove their seed phrase or even completely redeploy their node through our non-custodial node-management system. Removal of the existing customer mnemonics at **Allnodes** is required and will be strictly enforced. Our goal is to manage as few keys as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**3. Mnemonic of the address that holds the user‚Äôs stake**

In the case of **Tendermint**\-based networks, it‚Äôs common practice to self-stake only a small number of coins from the owner address and delegate the rest from a different wallet. This wallet can be a hardware wallet, for example.

The address that holds the user‚Äôs stake, which is delegated to their own node, has never been accessible to **Allnodes**, as we are a non-custodial service that does not hold custody of the customer‚Äôs coins.

Now that we have a solid understanding of these fundamental terms, let‚Äôs turn our attention to a word that often comes up in discussions about **VaaS** providers: ‚Äú**compromised**‚Äù.

When someone claims that mnemonics are ‚Äú**compromised**‚Äù on a **VaaS**, this is inaccurate for two reasons. First, there are no **VaaS** providers in the industry that do not have access to the validator‚Äôs private key, and by this logic, those keys must be considered ‚Äú**compromised**‚Äù together with mnemonics. Second, the term ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù is typically used to describe a security breach. However, **Allnodes**, for example, handles private keys securely and in accordance with industry standards, with customer consent.

In most industries, not just blockchain-related, service providers must have some level of access to customer systems or data. For example, server providers, even housing solutions, have physical access to the servers in the data centers. Managed server providers even have more privileges on the operating system than the customer himself. While blockchains often are referred to as a trustless environment, this is a perfect world scenario that is unlikely to be achieved.

To put it another way, if we want a world in which even the validator‚Äôs key is not shared, we must accept a world in which there are no VaaS providers at all. If all VaaS providers were to suddenly disappear from a network, the consequences could potentially be severe. The sudden disappearance of all VaaS providers could also affect user participation in the network, as it would become more difficult for them to launch and manage their nodes.

If individuals or entities like project builders are able to launch their own node without a significant amount of computer hardware and software knowledge, they may attract a diverse group of delegators. Consequently, they may feel more motivated to promote the network, take part in its development and governance, or be encouraged to attract new end-users.

In addition, large institutions are more likely to invest their funds or resources in a network that has strong service providers (including **VaaS**). Institutional investors typically prefer to invest in professionally managed and certified businesses. They may be more likely to consider an opportunity above one that does not offer these features. Failing to attract these entities can lead to a variety of challenges and potentially the network‚Äôs ultimate demise.

# Some VaaS providers are so large can they halt the network?

It is theoretically possible, but at this time we have not been able to find a **VaaS** provider large enough to accomplish this task. To provide some context on **Allnodes** capacity, when we released our non-custodial node management system, our customers‚Äô nodes were active on only **7 out of 26 Tendermint-based networks** that we support: **ATOM**, **CRO**, **DVPN**, **EVMOS**, **JUNO**, **LUNC** and **OSMO**. Our cumulative stake on most Tendermint-based networks remains very low and can be observed in the recently published transparency report: [https://www.allnodes.com/tendermint-transparency](https://www.allnodes.com/tendermint-transparency)

For example on **Cosmos** blockchain we have only one customer validator node and our cumulative stake is **less than 2% of total stake**.

# Unethical business attacks based on rumors and false assumptions

At **Allnodes**, we are proud of our reputation for providing impeccable service, and we attribute our success to our unwavering commitment to customer support, innovation, fairness and integrity. In fact, we believe that human kindness can go a long way in any relationship, which is why it also is a core value of our business. At **Allnodes**, we are fortunate to have cultivated relationships with tens of thousands of customers around the world.

In today‚Äôs business world, competition is fierce, and companies often use various methods to outdo their competitors. While competition can be healthy and beneficial to the industry, unethical practices can have far-reaching negative effects. One such unethical practice is for one company to attack another based on rumors and false assumptions.

Public attacks on competitors are also ethically problematic. When a company publicly attacks its competitors, it may be engaging in unethical behavior, such as spreading false or misleading information. This behavior violates ethical principles such as honesty, fairness and respect for others. In addition, advancing an agenda at the expense of a competitor may be seen as manipulative.

# Conclusion

At **Allnodes**, we are committed to developing tools and finding solutions that allow even new and inexperienced members of the **Cosmos** community to feel at home and actively participate in the network. We have implemented numerous innovations and enhancements to make it easy to participate in governance, staking, and operation of nodes with the click of a button.

# Here are just a few of the innovations and improvements that we have made in 2023:

1. To decrease our voting power and to encourage redelegation to smaller validators on the **Terra Classic** network, we announced on **December 31**, **2022** an increase of our node‚Äôs commission from **5%** to **10%** starting from **February 1**, **2023**.

2. On **January 27**, **2023**, **Allnodes** launched our groundbreaking non-custodial node management for **Tendermint-based** blockchains, which allows users to securely manage their nodes without the need for a third-party. This system allows node owners to effortlessly manage their keys, cast votes, adjust commissions, and perform other actions through a user-friendly interface that requires no deep technical knowledge. The system has already been in development for several months:

"What is Replicated Security?","ZoltanAtom","2023-02-21 17:23:35","**üë©‚ÄçüöÄüßë‚ÄçüöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄCosmonauts! You may have heard that Replicated Security is coming‚Ä¶**  


‚öõÔ∏èBy staking ATOM you will receive multiple new tokens from upcoming Consumer Chains.  


üéØThe Cosmos Hub is transitioning to become an Interchain Service Provider.  


***So, in detail, what is Replicated Security?***  


* Replicated Security is a new upcoming feature of the Cosmos Hub, that will be introduced with the Lambda Upgrade (V9).  Originally named Interchain Security (ICS), specifically Interchain Security V1.  As of today the correct term to use is Replicated Security  

* Replicated Security is a shared security model. The Cosmos Hub will be able to offer security to new projects launching as Hub-secured consumer chains.  The Consumer Chain is a blockchain that leases security from the Hub.  

* This means that the entire Cosmos Hub validator set is required to validate a consumer chain.  So the Cosmos Hub Validator Set is ‚Äò‚ÄôReplicated‚Äô‚Äô on the Consumer Chain, providing security.  For using this service, the Consumer Chain shares revenue with the Hub.  

* This revenue will be shared with [\#ATOM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATOM?src=hashtag_click) delegators/validators.¬†  So the Atom delegators will not only benefit from getting ATOM staking rewards, but also will receive additional revenue from consumer chains using Hub security. These will be claimable as ordinary staking rewards  

* So, what is this additional revenue?  If the Consumer Chain has a native token, ATOM delegators will receive the native token of the Consumer Chain.  If it doesn't have a native token, ATOM delegators will get application fees generated by the Consumer Chain.  

* A Consumer Chain can distribute revenues through:  Transaction Fees - Token Inflation - Application Fees  Transaction fees are generated by the Consumer chain activity, the % distributed to Atom delegators is by default 25%, but it can be increased and is subject to governance  

* The consumer chain can also allocate a portion of their native token inflation to the Cosmos Hub validators and delegators, as ‚Äúcontinuous airdrops‚Äù  If the consumer chain doesn‚Äôt have a token, it can provide application fees, like a percentage of the swap fees, usage fees etc  

* Atom Governance will play a key role in defining Consumer Chain rewards in the onboarding phase.  Each Consumer Chain will be onboarded through a governance proposal approved by both stakeholders and &gt;2/3 of the Hub validator set.  

* Today we had a first glimpse of Replicated Security, we saw that it is a shared security model that offers Atom delegators/validators additional revenue for staking ATOM.  But there is much more behind this feature‚Ä¶  

* With Replicated Security, the Cosmos Hub will give birth to the Atom Economic Zone.  An Atom-aligned ecosystem that will create new exciting dynamics yet to explore.  Cosmonauts we are entering an unexplored part of the Cosmos  

* More threads will be dedicated to exploring Cosmos Hub's new features and dynamics.   This is a beginner introduction to Replicated Security, that avoids technical information for later, focusing on a better understanding of the key terminology.

"Interchain Info community pool funding proposal going on chain early next week!","Timmy_SparkIBC","2023-02-19 01:59:44","The other week I made a post here about [Interchaininfo.zone](https://Interchaininfo.zone) which seeks to unify the Cosmos (and beyond) through aggregating information, content, and tools! You can see that post [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R8Fo7HpkKWRafIwSgE_KkNeKKECBTJNX?usp=share_link).  


I'm not sure how much people keep up with the Cosmos Hub Forums, but i just wanted to bring attention to our post, here [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-21-interchain-info-hub-funding/9822](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-21-interchain-info-hub-funding/9822), about a proposal we'll be going on chain with next week to ask for community pool funds to help us build it! Then, over the next couple months, we'll do the same for a bunch of other chains in the cosmos.   


Happy to answer any questions here or on the forums. Thanks all!

One thing I believe we lack severely in Cosmos, is quality education. There is so much that goes into blockchain in terms of security and general operations, and it gets compounded 10 fold in Cosmos, due to the massive amount of different concepts and capabilities that are enabled through IBC. \n\nWill Interchaininfo.zone, have any educational resources, where people can learn about Blockchain, validator/delegator relationships, Tendermint Consensus, ICS, Mesh Security, Babylon (BTC Security) and the ridiculous amount of other concepts that people need to understand? Maybe articles can be submitted, explaining concepts in Cosmos that people tend to not be able to really learn about, because they don‚Äôt have it readily available or don‚Äôt know where to look to find the answers? That way Interchain info can be a bit of a one stop shop of educational information as well as a central dashboard for people to view and interact with the greater Cosmos.\n\nI‚Äôve been really trying to wrap my head around how we as the Cosmos community can create content to educate people who don‚Äôt know or understand where Cosmos differs from regular monolithic blockchains. We really only have Medium articles, which get harder to find over time unless you really know specifically what you‚Äôre looking for. Or we have a few YouTubers who aren‚Äôt able to dedicate too much time to actual eduction, rather they tend to lean on hype and *Alpha*, over education. \n\nI‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on if Interchain Info may have this capability? I‚Äôm looking for a way to get some Cosmos education going, but I‚Äôm not sure where to start. Thought maybe being an educational content Hub, along side the resource Hub, maybe a good concept as well, for Interchain Info.""]"

"Liquid Staking Report February: $ATOM","germancryptokid","2023-02-17 17:12:17","**Current Adoption of LSDs: 0.3%**

**Conventional staked ATOM: 62.7%**

 

According to the Kopernikus News App's report on February 17, the market leader for liquid staking derivatives (LSD) provider is Stride Zone, with a total value locked (TVL) of 795k ATOM, followed by pStake Finance with 137k and StaFiHub with 68k ATOM. The whole market grew by 80% or 445k ATOM in absolute figures since the last report, with stATOM accounting for 305k, stkATOM for 119k, and rATOM for 21k of the total growth. 

In percentage terms, stkATOM recorded the largest increase with a growth of 695% since the last report, followed by Stride with a 62% growth and StaFi with a 44% growth. The report predicts an incredible increase in adoption in the near future once several lending markets accept LSDs or use them as collateral for decentralized stablecoins.

"Keplr Wallet IBC transfer: What is ""Source Channel ID""","ryskfinance","2023-02-16 02:43:31","Hello,

Looking to some IBC transfers in Keplr from personal wallet to personal wallet. So I turned on Dev mode and went to add a IBC Channel found the chain I wanted to transfer to, but didn't know what to put at the ""Source Channel ID""

The reason I am looking to use this option is because i have been accumulating different assets on Kujira on the Cheap. I want to get those assets to their home chain so I can use them. But the Kujira bridge is limited in options as well as most other IBC Bridges.

 There doesn't seem to be a clean way to transfer ""ANY"" IBC asset to any other IBC chain. Which I had always thought was the superpower of the Cosmos ecosystem. 

It makes sense that the main wallet of cosmos should be able to do it, but I am struggling with the process. 

If anyone has a guide or a better way to do it, I would greatly appreciate it.","2","[""My comment won't be helpful for your Kujira specific issue.

I never had any problems useing kujiras ibc interface. If it is easier for you use cosmostation and i think something similar leap wallet did very recently. As for sorce channel id it depends which blockchain you want to send to. You need to use mintscan. When you select blockchain (in your case kujira) go to relays and look for chain you want to send. If there are multiple relayers for the chain you are looking for then pick one that has the most transaction to be sure transfer is successful. Next when you select chain you need to look for relay id. For example if you want to relay to cosmos you need to type in channel-0. If you were to send from cosmos to kujira you would need to use channel-343. When useing advanced ibc and select the chain you want to send to. Next when it asks you to type in relay id dont just type channel number insted write for example \""channel-0\"".""]"

üí°The #Interchain¬†is a new technological paradigm that is open-source, interoperable and community-owned.  


üéØAt the ICF, we strongly believe in the values of open-source software development.  


üß©Yet open source is free to use but not free to maintain.  


‚öôÔ∏èSince 2019, the ICF has funded engineering teams to develop and maintain: Cosmos Hub, Tendermint Core, IBC, Cosmos SDK.  


‚ñ´Ô∏èWe provided financial support to the development of technologies like CosmWasm &amp; Ethermint.  


* In addition to the core Interchain Stack, the ICF funds projects to drive adoption and drive more use-cases.    

* For example, we run the [Interchain Developer Academy](https://academy.cosmos.network) An academy that successfully keeps bringing new developers and talents into the Interchain  

* *We run the* [*@BuildersProgram*](https://twitter.com/BuildersProgram)

&gt; An initiative to support teams and projects of every stage, building on the [\#Interchain](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Interchain?src=hashtag_click) Stack - accelerating the growth of the Interchain.

"Atom ICF' Delegation Policy Update","ZoltanAtom","2023-02-14 16:29:28","[Today we share an update on our Atom Delegations Policy](https://twitter.com/interchain_io/status/1625223595621228566?s=20&amp;t=p_FkxKl8wdrDcGCaEZDeYg)  


***Our target was to deploy our delegations under the revamped Atom Delegations Policy in Q4 2022.¬†  Unfortunately, we missed this.***  


ICYMI, [the new Policy of the ICF](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/icf-delegations-policy-a2c3f91e6e) was devised with extensive community consultation, to not only reward past contributions but to have a long-term sustainable solution to encourage positive future contributions that embody the soul of the community.  


To roll out the new evaluation and scoring criteria, it was essential to prepare a new set of tools to track contributions, create a fair and replicable evaluation system, and coordinate with multiple teams and individuals to effectively assess validator contributions.  


*We wanted to do it right - to not rush it and be stuck with a broken or unfair system.*  


Unfortunately, the end of 2022 marked significant changes for many organizations in the ecosystem, especially at the ICF.  


We went through (and are still working through) significant restructuring of our internal teams, particularly with regard to the engineering teams involved in the development of 3 of the 4 core products in the Interchain Stack.  


This restructuring compounded the issues we were having with evaluating the engineering contributions submitted - much of our engineering teams are no longer internal to the ICF, not to talk about the extra administration and coordination involved with this restructuring.  


To move forward, in Jan‚Äô23, we onboarded a team of engineers onto the Delegations Program - who are diligently assessing the [engineering and engineering-focused public good contributions](https://twitter.com/interchain_io/status/1586345651104784385).  


We were truly overjoyed to discover how active the [@CosmosHub](https://twitter.com/cosmoshub) validator community is.  Some of the contributions (e.g. availability of an IBC relayer) were easy to assess, while other contributions (e.g. a bug fix to Tendermint Core) required a deep dive.  


*We have now completed the detailed assessment of approx 90% of the 400+ contributions.*  


We are currently working on the remaining \~10%, standardizing the scores across the 5 different Contribution Categories, as well as double-checking the scores that any individual judge gave to a contribution - to ensure scores are fair and accurately replicable.  


Given our failure to meet deadlines on this revamped Delegations Program, we are hesitant to state a deadline for when the deployment of delegations will begin. But rest assured that the team is working on this as fast as possible.  


**At the ICF, we heard the voice of the community &amp; acknowledge the delay in delivering this program.  We express our apologies to the community &amp; hope the coming ICF Atom delegations will be fair to the invaluable contributions validators make. Thank you all for your patience!**

He suggested to overhaul Atoms tokenomics with the goal to have as much atom staked as possible. In order for atom stakers to remain liquid, a new token Photon would be issued which represents that staked Atom. Photon can then be moved across the cosmos and/or staked for governance voting. \nIt is basically liquid staking while remaining in possession of your own underlying stake.\nThe proposition stirred up a lot of discussion because of its complexity and lack of clarity. \n\nIf you are going to talk about controversial proposals, that one deserves a mention."",""Donating free money to Turkish earthquake victims.

Easy NWV"",""Juno Whale."",""Atom 2.0 was unclear, too ambitous and cramped with details. In addition, it was pushed by Zaki and people in his circle."",""There are two that come to mind. I could have missed or messed up some important details with these proposals, so feel free to chime in with added commentary or corrections!\n\n**Juno Proposal #16 - Correcting the gamed stakedrop**\n\nThis was incredibly controversial and early in the life of the Juno Network. Basically, there was an entity that managed a whole bunch of wallets, kind of like a bank, Japanese investors in the Cosmos Hub. This entity received a massive portion of the \""fairdrop\"" airdrop that was designed to create a highly decentralized initial distribution at Juno's genesis, but because of this entity, the chain was at risk of threat from a single, large token holder. That large token holder did not buy these tokens, but rather, received them at genesis.\n\nThe controversy stemmed from something we can all understand - the proposal was designed to perform an on-chain confiscation of tokens from this entity. Just the concept itself is pretty intense, but the public debate surrounding this governance proposal was spirited and enlightening. Some people called \""Yes\"" voters \""the mob\"". The most vocal of those people calling \""Yes\"" voters \""the mob\"" was the entity himself, who actually created a twitter account called something like \""the juno whale\"". It was all very dramatic and interesting.\n\nHere's the voter turnout for Juno Proposal #16:\n\n* Yes - 40.85%\n* No - 33.76%\n* Abstain - 21.78%\n* No With Veto - 3.59%\n\nThis proposal ***did pass.***  There were subsequent proposals related to this including #18, #19, #20, and #21.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cosmos Hub Proposal #82 - ATOM 2.0: A new vision for Cosmos Hub** \n\nLooking at the vote details, one can see how controversial this proposal was.\n\n* Yes - 47.51%\n* No - 1.82%\n* Abstain - 13.27%\n* No With Veto - **37.39%!!!**\n\nThis proposal ***did not pass***.\n\nThe fact that No With Veto was 37.39% says everything. There were a lot of players in the space that really disliked this proposal. There was a lot of drama between some of the significant players and founders of Cosmos Hub regarding this proposal. There were also some controversial elements related to the staking rewards, that introduced a significant amount of risk into the system for delegators in particular.\n\nThe ATOM 2.0 redesign was going to result in a lot less staking rewards from inflation, and a lot more of those ATOM emissions going towards a treasury to be used for investment in projects and funding the stewardship of the chain or something along those lines. This would shift the balance of issuance away from delegators, which rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. There was also a proposed initial 4,000,000 ATOM issuance directly to the community pool, which freaked a lot of people out.\n\nA lot of the ideas included in the ATOM 2.0 whitepaper seemed really cool and forward-looking, but the token economics seemed too heavily weighted in favor of the developers, and many investors / delegators responded with anger and a sense of betrayal.\n\nI look forward to a revised ATOM 2.0 whitepaper that rectifies some of the issues that the community had with the token economics."",""Prop 87. It raised deposit requirements for putting props on chain. Since prop 78, we haven't seen a single prop from the community. Every prop since then has been connected to the validators. \n\n Prop82. The shit show of a tiny group ready to print atoms into the high heavens, to give to a tiny \""council\"" and a \""treasury\"" only they have say over. 100s of millions of dollars for a tiny fee to do what they want with no oversight. \n\nProp 95. atom 2.0 in a smaller version. Again same folks, different faces all taking from the community pool with no oversight or obligations to the community. It's all just trust me bro. While ignoring all the feedback the community posted."",""I didnt follow everything but there was a contravention on evmos a few months ago maybe. There were some volunteers that did some job FOR FREE just to be clear. After a while they wanted to be payed for the job they did. While at first they mentioned that this was their good will after a while they requested funds from community pool. Vote went with no . Because firstly you said that you will do it for free and now all the sudden you want to be payed. After that they spamed a bit with their props how they should be payed for the work they did. And then after a while proposal went with hard no with veto. Then they pretty much were furious because they got punished for it. To make matters worse they continued with their proposals. Overall i think they had around 3 or 4 proposals vetoed. Can't remember all the details so someone correct me if I am wrong.""]"

"Hardware wallets will provide the innovations that make the app-chain thesis a success","Jcook_14","2023-02-13 10:00:32","One of the biggest challenges facing blockchain is the lack of education around security. Private key and wallet security as it stands today, lacks the ease that is needed to make the next generation of blockchain applications go mainstream.

I had never heard of Ledger Stax, and I heard about it on an interview and it kinda clicked for me that it really isn‚Äôt all on protocols to innovate. One of the big items of innovation needed is ease of use for people who don‚Äôt want to take responsibility or don‚Äôt really comprehend the responsibility of private key management. Not to mention, UI in crypto isn‚Äôt particularly good compared to a cell phone, however wallet providers like Keplr or Cosmostation do have a fair UI. But it‚Äôs still technical enough for people, that they may not want to get into Crypto due to the general confusion‚Äôs that happen regarding private keys. 

Mobile hot wallets like Keplr mobile for cellphones are good to help UI, but security and education is a serious problem. Sim swaps happen. I personally know people who have taken screenshots of their private keys before, because they don‚Äôt realize that all it takes is for someone to hack your Apple ID, and next thing you know they have access to your crypto all because of a screenshot. 

Hardware wallets are what can take crypto to the next level, and Cosmos‚Äôs app-chain thesis is in a perfect position to capitalize on such a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets can add the security and UI/UX necessary, to make Crypto DApps and app-chains gain the usability to go mainstream. A hardware wallet that has UI/UX similar to something like an iPhone, is what it really takes. A hardware wallet will have an AppStore. Some of these apps will be Ethereum DApps or other DApps, but scalability will obviously be an issue, and IBC and the app-chain thesis is the solution. 

Take it easy on me, honestly I‚Äôve had my head buried deep in the actual software components of blockchain and have largely ignored the hardware. When I heard about Ledger Stax, and saw the concept, it blew my mind. Please chime in and let me know any other crypto hardware components I should look at, I feel like it‚Äôs hardwares turn to take us into mass adoption and I want to be ahead of the curve if I can.","3","[""Tangem card . \n\nI bought Cardano Tangem card .

"Cosmos Check-In #11","satriapamudji","2023-02-11 22:45:25","Hey Cosmonauts, here is your eleventh check-in! The past week has been a back-and-forth rotation of liquidity between AI projects, to infrastructure projects, and back to AI projects.

On our own grounds, Akash was probably one of the few projects that saw an indirect advantage from the hype in AI project because of Akash AI‚Ä¶ but what about the rest of the Cosmos projects in the ecosystem?

If you‚Äôre new to these check-ins, the goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 10 minutes every week!

So, grab a coffee and let‚Äôs dive in.

**‚û§ Earthquake Situation in Syria and Turkey**

Before we dive in, I just wanted to touch on this topic personally for a while.

For those who aren‚Äôt caught up with the news yet, this week a massive magnitude earthquake rocked Turkey and Syria and it‚Äôs one of the most devastating tragedies in modern times.

In that regard, the Cosmos-community efforts are ramping up to support Turkey and Syria in these times of crisis, and if you want to support the rescue missions by donating or sharing the links provided by the kind souls from the Cosmos ecosystem, you can find it in our article.

**‚û§ Biggest news of the week**

The biggest news of this week has to be the fact that Cosmos is starting to fundamentally shift, after the introduction of Babylon, Skip and Interchain NFTs ‚Äî all of which are coming soon.

1. The rules of the Game of NFTs are currently being outlined, after Proposal 94 for 20k ATOM to fund this passed. Really exciting times for Interchain NFTs.
2. Babylon is now on their Testnet, with connections to 8 chains already.
3. Skip is integrated with Injective for MEV resistance.

It‚Äôs not exactly a one-time off from the news per se, but all of these combined, in my opinion, are bringing a really exciting future to the Cosmos ecosystem.

**‚û§ Tangible upgrades and launches**

This week, several updates and launches have been made in the Cosmos ecosystem.

1. Osmosis Stableswap, consisting of $BUSD, $USDT, and $USDC is now out.
2. Kava introduces their strategic vaults.
3. Umee releases the Historacle, a tool to prevent price manipulation

**‚û§ Non-tangible upgrades and proposals**

Next, we look at the non-tangible upgrades, which includes some exciting proposals that are either already on-chain and in the voting process, or will be up for voting in the upcoming days.

1. Evmos releases their 2023 roadmap, which emphaises on creating groundbreaking tools like the EVM Extensions and the Evmos SDK.
2. Kava 12 will be launching on February 15th at 15:00 UTC.

‚û§ **Other interesting happenings**

1. Sommelier‚Äôs recent Real Yield USD has been outperforming other high-quality yield opportunities and is the only option for users to gain access to optimized Uniswap V3 LP yield without managing it themselves.
2. Sentinel's vision of taking a market share of the Chinese VPN ecosystem is now becoming a reality with the addition of a new protocol on their GitHub.

**Wrapping it all up**

Kepler for ATOM (install browser extension, then use the dashboard at [https://wallet.keplr.app/](https://wallet.keplr.app/) ).

There's only really one way to stake MATIC (outside of Lido), and that's via their staking dashboard located here: [https://staking.polygon.technology/](https://staking.polygon.technology/) (which accepts MetaMask, CoinbaseWallet, WalletConnect). This is executing on Ethereum, *so your staking related fees will require ETH not MATIC, and the MATIC that you want to stake will need to be on Ethereum network, not Polygon PoS*\n5. Use polkadot.js browser extension and stake via Polkadot staking dashboard here: [https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview) . If you want to stake individually, you'll have to nominate up to 16 validators and require a min of approx 300 DOT. If you want to stake via a pool (similar to ADA), you'll not have to worry about nominator selection and the minimum to stake is 1 DOT, and there are 90 pools currently.\n\nAs far as I know, there's no wallet provider that supports all the mentioned coins. You can find wallets that support 2 or 3 max (eg: Enkrypt supports MATIC and DOT,  TrustWallet supports ALGO and ATOM, AtomicWallet, etc).  \n\nLedger Live is your best bet in covering as many staking coins from one wallet probably. \n\nCheers"",""Bro don‚Äôt use a hot wallet!

Include the IPFS link in your proposal text so that people viewing it on-chain can easily access historical content.\n&gt; - Let your top-level post in the forum be exactly the text you expect to put on-chain (except for the changelog and IPFS link).

"Wake the F up! DON‚ÄôT SLEEP ON OMNIFLIX!(or the $FLIX Drop)","chevvvvvvvvv","2023-02-10 12:46:50","Everyone loves a good underdog story. 

Everyone also loves the story of the unsung hero. 

Then you‚Äôve got the story of the guy that everyone looks past and naively forgets about‚Ä¶And then one day, you wake up on a beautiful sunny Spring morning, your girl is MIA - you happen to go on Instagram and notice she went live an hour ago from a ballin ass crib on a private island with that guy you thought was just her tutor. Truth is, he was lowkey Mr. Steal Your Girl, and you never saw it comin‚Ä¶ why? cause you were SLEEPIN on ‚Äòem! So I‚Äôll say it again‚Ä¶ DON‚ÄôT SLEEP ON OMNIFLIX FOLKS! 

OmniFlix is that volcano you thought was dormant until one day it suddenly busts a massive load of magma all over your front lawn, and if you‚Äôd have just paid attention to the little breaks in the ground over the last few years, you‚Äôd have been ready to fill those bags üòé - lucky for you, if you were sleepin, consider this the air horn that went off while you were prepping in the tee box - you‚Äôre not too late. I‚Äôll explain what I mean in greater detail, and ease up on the hyperbole, metaphors and other flawlessly utilized literary devices . . . 

#2) FLIX will be a very nice drop .. lots of snapshots over an extended period of time (that were not announced in advance) + keep in mind, that the drop will include the rewards from the multiple incentivized TestNets (assuming you participated) + any bonuses people have accumulated by being active in the network (via Burning OG NFTs later or selling them on the marketplace now). A couple months ago I saw someone list an OG NFT on the market for sale for around 500K HUAHUA and it sold. At the time that was around $50. That is a good indication of how the community is valuing FLIX at this juncture. 

#3) I may be slightly biased; but OmniFlix has chosen to take the road less traveled. Many projects will launch their token, and expect you (the community) to buy it, and fill their coffers for the unique opportunity to participate in their ‚Äúover-promise &amp; under-deliver‚Äù see-saw game, until eventually, one day, you notice their Discord server is dead or gone, and their domain name is now available on GoDaddy for $8.99‚Ä¶  OmniFlix on the other hand, has been contributing heavily to the Cosmos ecosystem since 2018, has never taken a dime of VC money - (bootstrapped almost entirely, in large part by being one of the most respected validators in the community), and with the 1 year anniversary of launching main-net (on 2/22/2222) quickly approaching, have already  deployed 4 dApps on chain: 

STUDIO - Mint, Manage &amp; Distribute NFTs - without writing a single line of code
(app.OmniFlix.studio)
MARKET - Monetize NFTs  
(OmniFlix.Market)
TV - publish &amp; monetize Interactive videos, live streams, pay-per-view, learn to earn initiatives &amp; more
(Alpha.OmniFlix.tv)
INSYNC - staking &amp; governance for cosmos sdk based chains. Claim all staking rewards at once in a single click
(OmniFlix.co)

OmniFlix ME &amp; Nucleus &amp; StreamPay are in development and will be launched this year .. 

#6) You might also have forgotten OmniFlix built the NFT ticketing Infra that allowed you to buy your Cosmoverse tickets (among others) with credit/debit or ATOM last year, and also did the Livestream of the event in 2021 during covid - and in 2022 from Medellin (6 broadcasts in 2 languages without a second of downtime)

#5) Did I mention, you guys keep asking #WenFLIX bc we don‚Äôt have a token yet? But we have minted over 150K NFTs and support ATOM OSMO JUNO &amp; HUAHUA on OmniFlix Market..

Now‚Ä¶ Last but not least, we arrive at #4 .. you might wonder why 6 &amp; 5 came before 4. There is of course a reason for this. Duh. Most of the things I do have plenty of pre-meditation. Except for murder because that makes it a capital crime. Just kidding - murder is bad. We nor I don‚Äôt promote or advocate for murder under any circumstance. But what we do advocate for is Minting 4 Hope. Which brings us to #4. See what I did there? I‚Äôm not done though.. 

If you don‚Äôt believe a word I‚Äôve said, you should - but in the event that you for whatever reason don‚Äôt, maybe you‚Äôll believe MLB legend, 3x World Series Champion, Bloody Sox guy, Mr. Curt Montague Schilling. Curt joined the #FlixFam back in September ‚Äò22 ‚Äî and we could not be more grateful for his decision. Truly - it is a match made in heaven. You might remember back in 2004, he wrote K ALS on his cleat to raise awareness for ALS, knowing the cameras would be constantly showing his bloody sock, as the warrior was pitching with a large open abrasion on his ankle ‚Äî it meant, Strikeout ALS. 

Curt has been in the fight to find a cure for ALS for 32 years. We quickly found that we had a mutual interest. My pet project since joining OmniFlix in March 2022 has been to utilize NFTs as a vehicle for NPOs to raise money and awareness for their cause. To facilitate things for the NPOs, we decided to partner with The Giving Block, to ensure all regulatory guidelines are abided by. Curt loved this concept, and we are working with him on something truly incredible, which appropriately will be the first initiative in OmniFlix‚Äôs Mint for Hope campaign, launching on June 2, 2023 - Lou Gehrig Day in the MLB lexicon. 

We will be doing particular initiative on a yearly basis with Curt, to continue raising awareness and educating people about this truly devastating disease, for many years to come.

Stay tuned for an interview with former MLB Cleveland Indians lefty pitcher, Jimmy Poole, who was diagnosed with ALS just a year and a half ago, on Minting 4 Hope with Curt Schilling on FLIX TV later this month.

It seems like they are going after custodial staking in general. Most of the complaints on the CC threads have been about minimum staking amounts being a hindrance. To go along with that, ETH chains have been hammered today with people moving funds. 

As someone that's been self-staking on Cosmos with no minimums, and enjoying cheap network fees the whole time, it really does make me feel good about the future of ATOM and the Interchain. Crypto should mean self-custody, and modular appchains work much better at scale. Seeing that even the average r/CC user is still sleeping on IBC is very exciting.

And I literally can't see any other chain implementing this aside from Cosmos Atom. 

Is there any way to create a Cosmos encoded framework where a an external IBC asset could be transported within the IBC system of Cosmos and any other IBC enabled Cosmos protocol itself?

Think of it of this. A cart/wagon trait that can latch an external asset (external chain not being IBC) to secure and transport the asset within it and any realm of Cosmo IBC interoperable chain, securily being latched through Cosmo Atom staking. Allowing external asset to be transported in and within the Cosmo interchain. The gas fees to create/or mint a cart/wagon would be based on what interchain would be creating the cart/wagon and the gas fees for the cart/wagon transportation would be paid within the fees of the interchain that had created/minted the cart/wagon in itself. Meaning fees for external transportation would be rewarded back to the stakers of that interchain itself.

The cart/wagon being interoperable would be able navigate/transport within any IBC enabled network in itself. What differentiates a cart/wagon is and would be what interchain network had minted/created it.

And would other network to be the station/hub of the cart/wagon itself than the Cosmos Hub/network.","2","[""If i understand you correctly you want cosmos hub to recive all of ibc transactions and using cosmos hub literally for transportation of assets.

Although in the future this might be a solution for other chains that are not part of cosmos. Setting up light clients, for multiple chain can be a hassle for non native cosmos chains. In theory you would need new light client for every new chain you want to connect . It requires a lot of knowledge and resources for some chains. So in the future this might be 1 of the options.

"Thought on ODIN protocol? Big DATA, AI , Oracle, cosmos","Maleficent_Orchid442","2023-02-08 21:04:45","Hey, Guys! What do you guys think about  ODIN protocol?

As someone invested in it and slowly built my position, I wanted to share my thoughts. I think ODIN may emerge as a huge thing in the AI big data and user-generated data space. It could revolutionize how we think about data ownership and monetization. Think about all the user-generated data we generate daily - from online shopping, movements &amp; social media. It's all collected, analyzed, and monetized by big tech companies. But what if we could put that data to better use? ODIN is a decentralized protocol that lets users securely and anonymously share their data with dApps. This way, they can contribute to developing AI models while retaining control over their data. They can even get paid for their contribution. With ODIN, user-generated data is no longer just a commodity. It's a valuable resource that can benefit everyone. So, if you're interested in the future of data and AI, I recommend checking out ODIN. Who knows, it is the next big thing!

"Important questions on Prop 95, the Cosmos Hub Grant Program","Timmy_SparkIBC","2023-02-07 11:41:05","I am realizing there is a slight divide between the Twitter and Reddit cosmos community, and im going to try and start bridging this gap with things I find important. I apologize that my bias will certainly come into play here, but i will do my best to just be a liaison of information, and little more. (This maybe isn't a the best first example of that however, as I do have strong opinions on this matter. see footnote)

To start with today, this thread by community validator Pupmoz about something called ""Timewave"" that seems to be a potential conflict of interest for prop 95 proposers [https://twitter.com/pupmos/status/1622784324578971648](https://twitter.com/pupmos/status/1622784324578971648) . I would also like to note that building something along side trying to launch a grant program, are not *inherently* conflicts of interest, in fact, when done right they *can* even synergize to everyone's benefit.

This thread is worth reading. Don't trust me or the Pup inherently, just as we're asking you to be skeptical of the grant proposal, but DYOR and make your voice heard.

Above all, if you come to a solid conclusion one way or another, remember to vote! otherwise your validator votes for you!

*I most certainly have an opinion in this matter, and i laid out my thoughts regarding it as openly as i could here, I encourage people to read it, as pupmos references it in his thread. Again, these are just my opinions, but my and other peoples questions not being addressed is just a fact.* [*https://forum.cosmos.network/t/re-funding-the-cosmos-hub-grant-program/9025*](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/re-funding-the-cosmos-hub-grant-program/9025)","13","[""Looks like it's passing.

These outsiders like folks from ripple labs, Delphi, and others, what are they in turn offering the community their taking funds from? What is the hub getting back for 7+million dollars? How can we really hold them to their word when there's no way to know where the funds will be? What happened if they loose the funds? They or others in the \""in crowd\"" get to just try again with another prop asking for $$$? No accountability.  Voting no on prop 95, no with veto if need be.

### 1. Interchain Security won‚Äôt have the expected success

Interchain Security and its upcoming first version, called ***Replicated Security,*** will be the very first shared security solution on Cosmos. The concept is simple: one chain, referred to as a *Provider chain*, provides its economic security to other chains, referred to as the *Consumer chains*.

There are numerous advantages to this, the first one being that the Consumer chain inherits the security of the Provider chain, making it equally secure. As a result, a Consumer chain using *Replicated Security* with the Cosmos Hub, benefits from an economic security of over $2 billion right from the start. Another benefit of that model is that the Consumer chain does not have to bootstrap its own set of validators set, as the validator set of the Provider Chain will directly produce blocks for the Consumer chain.

In return for this, it is expected that Consumer Chains will compensate ATOM stakers and validators. This model may appear attractive at first, but there are several points that could prevent it from being as successful as it appears to be. Let‚Äôs analyze this further.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Scalability issues**¬†

In its current form, Interchain Security is not scalable due to the necessity for validators to run a new node for each new consumer chain. This results in an expensive and resource-intensive infrastructure to maintain for validators.

It is unthinkable to imagine 1,000 Consumer Chains using *Replicated Security* due to the heavy infrastructure it would require for validators. If there is an ambition to reach this goal, a lighter solution for validators must be found.

 

* **Compensations**¬†

As a validator, the hardware setup to run an ICS chain with *Replicated Security* is exactly the same as for the Cosmos Hub. Therefore, the cost is linearly related to the number of chains added; this means that adding just one ICS chain will double the infrastructure cost for the validator. Does it double the income though? The answer is no.

Each project that wants to use *Replicated Security* must go through governance and be accepted as a Consumer Chain by the validators and stakers. Therefore, they will closely monitor the compensation the project is offering, as it is reasonable to expect remuneration for the benefits *Replicated Security* provides. If the project is not providing adequate compensation to validators and stakers, or none at all, it is unlikely that they will be accepted by governance, unless they offer something highly strategic to the Cosmos Hub.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Sovereignty**

Under replicated security, the Consumer chain is not sovereign in block production as it is completely dependent on the validator set of the Provider Chain. Therefore, Consumer chains are basically transferring value to another blockchain.

Not having control over its block space will become an issue for the most successful Consumer chains, especially those that will generate a great amount of MEV activities. Therefore, it is likely that the most successful consumer chains will not remain as Consumer chains to have full control over their blockspace. Because why would you bring value to the stakers and validators of another chain, when you can bring this value to stakers and validators of your own chain if you become a sovereign Appchain?

I view Interchain Security as an Incubator, providing projects with security and without the need to worry about a validator set, allowing them to grow and become a sovereign Appchain for the most successful ones. If this were to happen, we may wonder what the future of Interchain Security would be if all successful Consumer chains were to leave.

Of course, that does not apply to projects that that prioritize security over everything else. For example, the upcoming generic purpose issuance chain is expected to issue native USDC, so using Interchain Security makes sense as native stablecoins are crucial for the ecosystem. Similarly, a liquid staking chain should prioritize security and Interchain security is a good long-term option, given that the Cosmos Hub has the largest economic security within the Cosmos.

There are still points to be addressed to make Interchain Security successful, and scalability should be the primary focus. Alternative versions to Replicated Security exist; the opt-in version has an issue with the [subset problem](https://informal.systems/blog/replicated-vs-mesh-security), and ICS v3 appears to be less attractive than Mesh Security.","13","[""As you describe it, wouldn't this ensure quality projects come to market as validators would serve as gatekeepers?\n\nAlso, isn't interchain security an added perk to the current system, in which validators already pick projects and run nodes for those picks?"",""Valid points, but I don't know how many people think ICS is going to be some huge game changer out the gate. Just like any major change, the infrastructure deployment is the first step. To me it's more of a long-term solution set and a competitive differentiator for Cosmos. Naturally it will evolve based on demand."",""Thanks for the detailed post. Logical disscusions are the best thing in the bear phase. Cheers."",""This perspective isn‚Äôt incorrect. ICS isn‚Äôt the savior of Cosmos or the Hub. It is in fact all of this article says it is, however it gives an option to not have to attract your own validator set. It allows the chain, to lease its own blockspace, leveraging the largest economic security network in the Interchain. \n\nIt‚Äôs not intended to scale to massive heights, we honestly shouldn‚Äôt try and make it scale to massive heights (although V2-V3 will help scaling a ton, from what I have heard). That doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt attract multiple extremely valuable chains to ICS, so the validators can make money, and find the value in ICS as well. Ultimately, ICS is going to challenge the Cosmos Hub validators and delegators, and maybe Mesh Security ultimately becomes a better form of ICS but without the Hub Validator set, rather multiple chains contributing security to each other. However, I imagine a world, where ICS and mesh security are both valuable, and contribute to the value of the Hub and the rest of the Cosmos.""]"

"The Cosmos runs off of CosmWasm, and it's builders are in trouble.","Timmy_SparkIBC","2023-02-06 07:32:28","Just because I noticed that there's no real talk about it here on reddit, I'd like to bring everyone's attention to the Confio situation.

For those that don't know, smart contracts in Cosmos are written with CosmWasm/Rust, similar to how Ethereum contracts are written in Solidity. It, as well as some other elements of the Cosmos stack, are in part or almost entirely maintained by [https://confio.gmbh/](https://confio.gmbh/) who has recently announced they are pausing operations due to a lack of funding.

You can get more info on the situation, [here](https://twitter.com/confio_tech/status/1620780203818754048) and [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/confio-is-looking-for-a-champion-within-the-cosmos-hub-community/9599/24)

This is absurd of course, and I have ample faith in the community to rally around them and solve this problem, genuinely. I don't think there's need for major concern. But the more people that aware of it, the faster it will be remedied.

Myself and the Spark IBC team are offering to step in wherever would be helpful to support Confio, and we really encourage others to do the same, even if that just means voting yes on certain on-chain props. On our end, at the bare minimum, we will soon have a campaign live on our site for people to contribute directly to a Confio Support Pool, but we hope we'll be able to do more in time.

This post was really just to raise awareness, and to show to everyone that Cosmonauts can rally around causes that are worth it üî•üî•  


UPDATE IN COMMENTS BELOWüëá  
Tune in on monday for more info on them getting community pool funding!  https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YqKDoAVoQOxV?s=20","77","[""Oh gosh, this seems vital! I actually was unfamiliar with their contributions until this post! What can we do to help? Just... talk about it? Raise awareness?"",""Good to know, thanks for the update\n\nEDIT: Funding shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, that‚Äôs one of the reasons we have a treasury and this is absolutely worth the money to keep it going."",""[removed]"",""We're too busy giving a billion dollars to some yahoos in Prop 95 to fund the basics."",""What if we use this [template](https://github.com/alatuszam/gov/blob/main/confio-signaling.md) to raise proposals in every Cosmos chain that is using (or plans using) CosmWasm? If we create a community-pool spending proposal in every Cosmos chain and start making noise in the most active discord channels of Cosmos-based projects, we should be able to make enough pressure on every chain governance to chip in with some funding. A lot of chains have ecosystem funding, so it shouldn't be an issue to fund CosmWasm from that (that's exactly what ecosystem funding should be for!)  \n   \nTbh from a game theory perspective, keeping funding Confio or any organization that keeps developing and maintaining CosmWasm is key for the success of the Cosmos ecosystem. If the spending is socialized across the different chains, we should be able to fund CosmWasm   \nIt feels like the Cosmos SDK it's just starting to get real momentum, and it would be reckless for major Cosmos-based projects not to help in this.   \nI think we could:   \n1) Draft a community-spend proposal or ecosystem fund spending proposal for every major Cosmos chain   \n2) Make some noise in every major discord about the proposal for that specific chain (so we can get a sense of how much capital can be deployed from every chain into supporting CosmWasm   \n3) Boost on socials (twitter, reddit..) all the chains that are contributing for the common goods, while asking to chains that did not chip in why they don't do the same   \nThis seems to be a great opportunity for \""converging decentralization\"" when it comes to funding CosmWasm, as this would be the key to a successful multi-chain ecosystem   \nAlso, we could ask every chain to help in contributing how they can. For example, i see that even if the [CosmWasm academy](https://academy.cosmwasm.com/) does not get enough support anymore, there can be other initiatives that can help. For example, i am learning a lot about how to develop CosmWasm smart contracts with [Area-52](https://area-52.io/). If every project can take some work to help with taking CosmWasm tasks, this will help the economic burden of Confio"",""QQ as an outsider : \n- Does the Confio team develop Wasm smart contracts on Cosmos? \n- Provided that the team can receive the requisite amount of funding, will they be open to developing WASM smart contracts for another WASM based chain (that's not yet part of Cosmos ecosystem?)\n\nDo let me know if this is the case and I can get your team in touch with the requisite people. They'd be at ETH Denver as well, recently announced a grants program as well. They could pitch in a 100k or more.\n\nPersonally, even though I find the conflict of public goods space with ponzification of finance, still think that open source developers outside the VC/ICO cabal must be supported for their development efforts."",""Nice work!  Click bait skills are on point and being used in a positive way. For that sir, I believe an upvote is well deserved!"",""Yep, So frustrating that they actually do really important work and they definitely deserve funding. I'm sure all cosmos networks using cosmwasm (Osmosis, Juno, Secret, many others) must create a foundation and donate on regular basis for Confio and have grants programs to solve issues and incentivize protocols and etc."",""Oh my,I'm not gonna sleep tonight now."",""UPDATE:  \nPossible in addition to other efforts, but as a definite first step, Confio will be going on-chain to ask for community pool funds for funding their operations.

"Suggestions for specifics and mandates, for Prop 95","Jcook_14","2023-02-06 05:13:50","One of the main issues I have with the accelerator DAO, is I‚Äôm not sure what part of Cosmos it intends to accelerate. I prefer to have a stated objective. I prefer that these ATOMs go directly towards ICS exclusively (albeit, I do wish it was a smaller amount), and new initiatives with different governance models can come up and provide grant funding for different parts of the Hub. An example of what I‚Äôd like stated, for this grant program:

- We are to use this 588,000 ATOMs to fund projects that are building or intend to build on Interchain Security, and use our social influence to try to gain more meaningful consumer chains. (This can also give ICS chains a central point of funding, and in turn, this grant program can keep these chains on track in the building phase, and would also be able to lock chains into ICS better than what we currently have now. Not that this program becomes a central point of ICS, but rather a mediator, making it easier for chains that wish to become a Hub consumer chain.)

- We will use these 588,000 ATOMs to help fund research initiatives to make ICS more effective and efficient, giving forward momentum to bring V2/V3 of ICS to the forefront of the Hub. (A central point of research funding for ICS, as Informal has been the main contributor to ICS, it may be good if this grants program, intended to help fund and connect Infomal with new teams, looking to help build out ICS into its V2/V3 implementations.)

If these were the sole, stated goals of this grant program, I would vote yes for the current 588,000 ATOMs, as I believe ICS alone is worth that type of money being poured in to benefit the Hub. So long as this program‚Äôs sole intent was to build the hell out of ICS and ICS research.

"I'm trying to make the rapidly growing Interchain easy to navigate for the massive","Timmy_SparkIBC","2023-02-05 05:38:44","Hi all!

My name is Timmy and I spend almost all my time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/TendermintTimmy), so I might not be a familiar face around here! I wanted to introduce myself and what I'm trying to do for the ecosystem. Because i need your support!

I've been in crypto since BTC was single digits, but until I found Cosmos, i was just a degen trader who loved the tech but didnt have anything really stand out or call to him. By the time IBC was enabled in the Cosmos, however, I had come to realize that the ONLY possible future is a multi-chain one, and Cosmos had by far the biggest head start on it. So I became a cosmonaut and have loved every second of it.

**The Problem**

However, it's made me realize quite a few things about the Cosmos, namely that we do not have our ""shit together"". Specifically, in that we talk about being a unified interchain, but in reality it's quite fragmented. This leads to two things:

1. Investors and builders are turned away because the cosmos looks like a collection of small, independent blockchains still figuring everything out.
2. Users are turned away because its really confusing to navigate, there are many in Cosmos RIGHT NOW that don't even really understand that these protocol names they hear all the time, like Juno and Osmosis, are SEPARATE CHAINS.

**Spark IBC**

So this has been the entirety of my focus for the past year or so. In early 2022, we launched [Spark IBC](https://sparkibc.zone) which aims to support any and all chain agnostic efforts in the interchain. At the moment, we offer a funding platform where users can contribute to various efforts and be recognized for those contributions with Spark Points. However, we want to expand to far more than just funding. We want to be an entity that help to steward multi-chain efforts in whatever ways they need, from BD connections and marketing, to grants and community pool funding.

We want Spark to be a platform that anyone can use, but we will also use it for our own efforts, as we are right now with Interchain Info.

**Interchain Info**

Interchain Info is an effort by Spark IBC to create a unified front for the Interchain, including everything from learning about people and protocols, to discovering and using tools and Dapps.

We're a big believer in three things, 1. Interchain Info 2. The concept of show before you tell, and build before you ask for money, and 3. That something like ICI cannot be privately funded by investors. It's utility hinges in large part on it being beholden to no one but the community that uses it.That's why we've already built out 2/3 of the core offering from ICI with personal funding, however, the final 1/3 is out of our reach simply because our team specializes in Web2 development, and so we'll need to outsource or bring in new team members for the web3 stuff needed to complete that final third part. More info below.

*The following is from the campaign info for ICI currently on Spark IBC.*

***^(Start)***

We're building Interchain Info (ICI) with one purpose in mind, **to aggregate the vast amount of content, tools, and dApps that are scattered throughout the Cosmos into one, easy to use website.** With community support, we believe we can optimize new user onboarding and provide a tremendous amount of value to existing users of the Cosmos and beyond.

Interchain Info is a website with three primary offerings:

1. **The Index**
   1. A comprehensive encyclopedia of the Interchain with pages covering every major project, chain, validator and more.
   2. This section's first iteration is already built out, with a vast amount of content already ingested &amp; categorized. We plan to continue adding features and improving the UX over time and work closely with projects and active community members to continue adding content as we grow.
   3. We strongly believe that UI &amp; UX flows are as important to our end goal as the actual content they support, and so we believe the UI/UX will adapt and change overtime. We will continue to iterate on these aspects with the help of our users based on feedback and usage patterns.
2. **Resource Hub**
   1. This section provides long term hosting, organization, promotion, and SEO optimization for community content such as articles, twitter threads, audio recordings, videos and more.
   2. The first version of the Hub is currently being finalized alongside the Index. Again, we plan to improve upon this over time as well as work with projects &amp; their community to keep it updated &amp; brimming with the best content available.

Both the Index &amp; the Resource Hub are currently being tested in a closed Beta and should be available to the public through an open Beta by the end of December.

While some funds from the campaign will pay for the ongoing development and maintenance costs, the majority of the funding from this campaign will go towards building out the third, and arguably most fun, part of our site: The Dashboard.

1. **The Dashboard**
   1. The Dashboard aims to become a customizable **home page** and **command center** of sorts for every Cosmos user. When visiting the dashboard for the first time, a user will be able to pick which ‚Äúmodules‚Äù they want displayed for ease of access (i.e. REstake, Hubble Tools, Yieldmos, Rango, etc.).
   2. We believe this will greatly improve the user experience for commonly used applications and finally address the aforementioned fragmentation issue in regards to finding smaller tools and dApps.
   3. The tool we intend to build for 2023 (work in progress name, ‚ÄúMyTx‚Äù) allows users with no coding knowledge to build custom transaction flows that execute instantaneously. For example, let's say you find an NFT you want to buy using the HubbleTools module, and while you don't have any stars, you do have some pending $ATOM staking rewards. Without leaving the page, this tool would let you quickly assemble and execute the following with a few clicks:

***Claim ATOM staking rewards ‚û§ IBC ATOM to Osmosis ‚û§ Swap ATOM for STARS on Osmosis ‚û§ IBC STARS from Osmosis to Stargaze***

With the advent of Interchain Accounts, this can be reduced to a single click for execution.

1. Users who have earned Spark Points from their contributions on the Spark platform will be able to save these TX combos as templates for future use. The more Spark Points you have, the more template slots will be available to you.
2. We also have plans to work with CronCat to enable users to convert these combos into recipes and in turn, automate them.
3. Our team, who has already built out much of the rest of the site, is far more specialized on the Web2 front, so we will need to hire talent to help us build out the Dashboard. This is where the majority of raised funds will be allocated.

So while we are currently accepting donations for ICI on [sparkibc.zone](https://sparkibc.zone), we fully realize that something like this needs substantial funding to be worth pursuing, and that won't come from private donors alone.As noted above, Spark wants to provide more for its campaigns than just public donations, and so for this ICI campaign we are exploring something that we'd like to offer as a service to others in the future, and that is multi-chain funding props.

At the moment, nearly 100% of community pool funding requests are used only for stuff on the chain that they came from. This is both understandable, but also a massive issue when you consider there IS no central entity that could play that role for multi-chain things. ICF/AiB/Ignite/Informal etc, are simply *not* playing this role, it's unfortunate but there's no way around it.

So we want to pioneer a new way of funding multichain efforts that involves asking for funds from many different community pools in a way that both seems fair to everyone involved, and gives something back specifically to the chains that pass the props, this way incentives are aligned for everyone involved.

In our case, we have worked out the rough details for how we'll be approaching funding ICI. We will be asking for 1% of a wide number of Cosmos chain's community pools, with a cap of 20k from any one pool. In addition, 50% of the granted funds from any given chain will be set aside for our Content Incentives Program. This program rewards community members for contributing to content on the site related to the chain/ecosystem where the funds originated from.

For example if the Osmosis community gives us $20k, then $10k will be reserved for incentivizing content about Osmosis across the site.

Details of this can be found here - [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-wide-funding-of-interchain-info-through-current-spark-ibc-campaign/8936](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-wide-funding-of-interchain-info-through-current-spark-ibc-campaign/8936) and with the most recent updates, here [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jKklC30XZAQFidRlwbU-MxVdkWcu3B1VolfRV4cf57w/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jKklC30XZAQFidRlwbU-MxVdkWcu3B1VolfRV4cf57w/edit?usp=sharing)

We really want the community to be a part of everything we build, and so while im partially making this post just as a, ""Hello all, here's what we're doing!"" sort of update, I'd also like to encourage people to give feedback and suggestions.

A place similar to a forum, where the community may ask questions and get to know the different validators before they delegate.

"Cosmos vs. competitors: security and development","Greedy-Relative-8823","2023-02-04 00:11:27","I know this has been addressed before. The threads that I've found comparing Cosmos to other competitors (I've mostly been thinking predominately in the context of Ethereum, Polygon, and Polkadot) but are from 2021 and before. Feel free to link with something more updated!  


Can anyone comment on important distinctions between these networks? I'm particularly interested in security and developing (below).

A criticism I've stumbled onto several times with Cosmos is that it is much less secure than competing networks (at least blockchains above). Is this still the case, and if so, why? 

Also, from the standpoint of a developer, which network (again, thinking about Ethereum, Polygon, and Polkadot) is easiest and/or most rewarding to build on (maybe it depends on what you're building)?

Bear with me. I'm relatively new to crypto and much more so to Cosmos. I'm excited about Cosmos, but I don't feel super comfortable yet, and I'm trying to decide where to spend my time. Thanks!","12","[""Other comments on here have some good info, but I want to go alittle deeper in to Cosmos, and some of the rationale behind why economic security was left ultimately up to the sovereign chains, and what projects and features are helping to make that a non-issue.\n\nThe Cosmos model has been ease of interoperability, and so far it far exceeded any other chain trying to make interoperability. All that a chain needs is a light client, to essentially act like a ‚Äútranslator‚Äù of sorts, to communicate to the other blockchain. However, the trade off made was, that left chains to obtain their own economic security models, and find their own validator set. \n\nThere is currently no model where chains spin up, and use the Hub or any other chains security, however, ICS will somewhat solve this problem, but not entirely. ICS/Interchain Security (AKA Replicated Security), will enable for new chains to spin up and rather than finding their own validator set, they will simply lease the Cosmos Hubs set. By doing this they would pay the Hubs validator set, in their native token, for validating their transactions. However, this is not a permissionless fix, and is governance gated. Meaning, each chain will have to gain Governance approval on the Hub, and if that chain doesn‚Äôt produce economic value, post launch, they can be removed from the Hubs ICS model via governance. The first version of Interchain Security, will be released, most likely by the end of this month. However, there are two other versions of ICS, that can make ICS, more efficient and have much more utility, for sovereign chains to gain economic security from the Hub. However, those are far away, and for now, we will start with version 1. \n\nI do like Polkadot, Polygon, ETH and an assortment of other chains who have a more economic security minded approach. However, Cosmos built interoperability better than anyone else has the ability too at this point, and their technical security is so good, that chains larger than the Cosmos Hub use Tendermint because it‚Äôs such a good secure piece of technology. So to say Cosmos doesn‚Äôt care about security, just because they didn‚Äôt start out with the goal of shared economic security, is very incorrect. Tendermint is about as close to mass adoption for developers, as any piece of crypto tech at the moment, and that was developed by the team who built the Cosmos and IBC. \n\nCosmos played a different ball game, from inception, however, now they have the ability to start worrying about the economic security and features like ICS on the Hub will help solve this. But even more than that, mesh security will likely be a massive contributor to the economic security of the Interchain. Celestia and Saga are both bringing their own unique and extremely impressive versions of shared security to the Interchain as well. Shared security, replicated security, mesh security and other economic security models are currently being built in the Cosmos and without IBC being implemented the way it was, these new, innovative models wouldn‚Äôt even be possible. It‚Äôs pretty amazing to see.\n\nEDITED: additional context added in some areas."",""Just my 2 cents not an advice. \n\n\nEtherium since its upgraded to 2.0 became very centralised because majority of eth that is staked with cex services and provider that offer liquid staking option such as lido. You can have over 10000 validator if you want but still majority of locked assets are currently with small number of validators which is not a good thing.\nAs for usability of eth you have 2 options L2 or high fees. L2s are okay and the only thing actually keeping eth alive. \n\nPolygon is a fork of tendermint and uses old cosmos sdk. As for validators in general there was some contradiction on last upgrade since minority of validator decided that upgrade should be done. But as I looked further a lot of validators seem to have neglected their duties as only 15 validators were involved in governance of the fork. Security issues could happen as theybstill use old cosmos sdk. I didn't check if polygon did something about this but a few months back Binance chain has been hacked because there was a  vulnerability in old cosmos.sdk. Cosmos suggested that every chain that uses cosmos sdk should update it. \nPolygon is ment to be, as i understand, an internet of blockchains on eth, but other than bridging that already exists on L2s i don't see much of what they promise. \n\nThe real competitor to Cosmos is Polkadot. The biggest difference is the way they function. Polkadot uses parachains and it has some limitations as how much parachains can it have. Currently i think it is about 100. After that they need to have a seperated chain in order to have more parachains. That is where kusama enters as it is a sister chain. The current problem they will solve is useing cosmos ibc(inter blockchain communination) to use it as a bridge between kusama and polkadot. Also polkadot has shared security meaning polkadot secures other 100 parachains and all fees are paid in dot. \n\nMeanwhile cosmos does not have limitations in terms of number of chains. Difference here is that cosmos (in the future there will be shared security for new chains) does not have shared security like dot. Every chain has its own set of validators and every chain is seperated from each other while still connected with cosmos ibc. \n\nCurrently the most chain that has fulfilled its purpose is cosmos. I wrote a post on r/cc recently it migh5help you understand. https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/108gtgo/cosmos_ibcinterblockchain_communication_how_close/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"",""You're in the Cosmos sub so i'll give you the biased answer i hope you're expecting. \n\nAs far as security goes Dot has shared security and it will be a long time till the whole interchain has something like that. Dot has us on security. But at the same time Cosmos has never faced a security issue. For both projects you're only as strong as your code so far. \n\nBoth Osmosis and Acala have suffered losses due to bad code. Osmosis had an update and didn't check the old code and a bug came out with the update and if you deposited liquidity and took it right back out without bonding you got 2x your money. Once they found out, from a redditor no less, it took 10 mins to halt the chain. Took 4 days to fix. Those affected got 2 airdrops.\n\nAcala had a bug with their interBTC pool and and 3b of aUSD was minted. They recovered 2.97 of 3.02b aUSD. They were down for almost 2 months. aUSD is .57cents atm. Not sure if anybody been reimbursed. \n\nbut is that the security you're even talking about idk. Are we talking about being able to take over a chain when we say security and shared security. Never happened or came close to my knowledge in Cosmos. \n\nIn a crisis i'll take Cosmos validators and developers. Occasionally stuff comes up for all chains. Ada handled their buisness last week with that thing. Anytime our validators have had to scramble it's been impressive response times. When Terra collapsed all our sovereign chains and IBC were fine. Handled all loads.\n\nDot may have better security but if both are perfect from preventing network attacks....\n\nAs far as development this is where dot runs into a wall. What's been developed and live on the parachains has been underwhelming. Stellaswap is ok. That's it. Im very biased when i say there's not a dot asset i see worth putting money into. Not saying they won't go up in a bull. All Dot will with that marketcap. but it's not going to be because people are finding and using Dot. Like people are with Cosmos anyway. \n\n\nDot devs aren't very good. That simple. Just went to Polkdadex to check it out. It's down. Mainet went live in Oct. Their products are just not attractive to defi users. Not to anyone but the newest people or most hardcore bag holders. For being an interoperability chain they're pretty weak on that front. I\""m judging this based on how easy it is to get x coin across the chain. Like i can get stars or juno from anywhere in Cosmos. Liquidity is fragmented. \n\n[Here's an article by a project that left Dot for Cosmos](https://blog.syntropynet.com/post/syntropy-chooses-cosmos-for-web3-development/)\n\nCosmos has great developers. That simple. Osmosis, Kujira, Wynd Dex, Crescent are all products i use. Been getting into and really enjoying Kujira. Used it's orderbook today w Mars and it went well lets say. I don't use Injective or Canto but they definitely have users. Somm and Umee are growing respectable TVLs and use. I use Stargaze, Tori for NFTS and i have used Omniflix and Stashh and all were good experiences. Cosmos products focus on UX and it makes a big difference. \n\n\nCan't speak as to what Dot has coming up but we have some very interesting things launching this year. Neutron, Sei, Noble, Saga, and a little further out Babylon. and plenty more. Dydx is going to be a big test for us to see how well a protocol coming from Eth does. \n\nIf you looked into any of those you see the kind of things people are putting out on Cosmos. Our tech stack is top 3. Maybe #1.\n\n\n\nI'm no matic expert, ive only used Quickswap and OnePlanet. but onboad was easy, dapps were good. I hear it's centralized for a crypto project. My line of where something is too centralized is probably further back than some purists. Haven't heard any complaints of developing on Matic. Nor any security issues that wasn't bad code. Just remembered i lost some money on Iron Finance i think it was called on Quickswap in early 21. Worst i heard was a big mint can slow the network.

Let's say I DCA and buy 20 more ATOM today. Cool...

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's say I want to add that 20 additional ATOM to my current validator.... Do I have to delegate twice to the same pool (I.E. have two separate delegations to the same validator) Or is there a way I can just add more to my current delegation?

With SOL you have to create a brand new delegation every time you DCA, or unstake... wait.... withdraw... then restake with your newly acquired SOL. Extremely annoying.

I just want to take my DCA purchases and add them to my current delegation without having to create new delegations every time I DCA. The unstaking process is extremely long and tbh... I don't want to have tons of different delegations cause I DCA and stake every DCA purchase.

‚òÑÔ∏èCometBFT is a fork of, and a successor to, Tendermint Core, and will serve as the official replication engine powering the Interchain Stack.The long-term vision for CometBFT is to be the primary choice of replication engine for reliable, secure, large-scale, application-specific blockchains. Commit your blocks with CometBFT today!

üìù[Announcement Blogpost](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/cosmos-meet-cometbft-d89f5dce60dd)

üí°**Q&amp;A**

***üîéWhat is the consensus algorithm underlying CometBFT?***

‚òÑÔ∏èThe consensus algorithm underlying CometBFT is currently based on (i.e., is an implementation of) Tendermint Consensus.

***üîéWill CometBFT move away from the Tendermint consensus algorithm?****‚òÑÔ∏è*Not in the initial releases. We aim to build CometBFT as a composable consensus library where the default consensus algorithm can easily be swapped out for others, but not limited to the ones implemented by the core maintainers.

‚òÑÔ∏èWe also plan to work with teams that made changes or optimizations to the consensus algorithm or elsewhere (see forks by LINE, PeggyJV, SeiNetwork, or Celestia Org) towards upstreaming the modifications that other users need into the main development line.

***üîéWill there be multiple competing forks of Tendermint Core powering the interchain?****‚òÑÔ∏è*It‚Äôs all open-source, so there could be. However, the canonical building blocks will build on top of CometBFT. Cosmos chains are built with the Cosmos SDK (@cosmossdk), which will build on top of CometBFT. Cosmos SDK development will continue as usual.

‚òÑÔ∏èAt the IBC level, libraries will continue to support Tendermint light clients; CometBFT contains an implementation of the Tendermint consensus algorithm, therefore Tendermint light clients will continue work with CometBFT as usual.

‚òÑÔ∏èAny team may fork CometBFT and replace the replication engine in their applications. But we recommend you get in touch with us if you require significant changes (see ‚ÄúHow to find support?‚Äù above). We will take your needs into consideration and adapt our technical roadmap accordingly to avoid, if possible, unnecessary or insecure forks.

***üîéWill this cause any chain to fork?****‚òÑÔ∏è*A firm ‚Äúno‚Äù. Tendermint Core v0.34-based systems can be upgraded to CometBFT v0.34. And CometBFT v0.34 line will stay compatible with Tendermint Core v0.34.

***üîéIf I am validating on a Tendermint Core-based network, are there any concerns for my operations?***

‚òÑÔ∏èWe will carefully signal to break changes in the release changelog, and breaking changes will be minimal. The binary name for Tendermint Core will be changed, but most applications have an app-specific binary (such as osmosisd,gaiad) with Tendermint Core compiled in (replaced by CometBFT). Unless you run a separate Tendermint Core binary, this will not affect your operations. A relevant change is that the TMHOME¬†env var will be renamed into CMTHOME. Sub-commands such as gaiad tendermint might be renamed in due time, depending on the team maintaining the binary. This will also be clearly marked in the changelog.

**üîéWhat happens to tendermint-rs?**

‚òÑÔ∏èWe will rename this project shortly to cometbft-rs and continue development.

***üîéWhat happens to tm-db or tm-load-test?***

‚òÑÔ∏èWe forked and renamed tm-db into cometbft-db and will continue development. No APIs were otherwise broken, and usage is the same, except it‚Äôs a different Go module:

    github.com/cometbft/cometbft-db

We will move and rename tm-load-test to cmt-load-test and will continue development. Note: Some of the above names might still be in flux.

"Why I believe Prop 95 should be broken down into multiple treasury subDAOs and a R&amp;D centralized grant funding entity.","Jcook_14","2023-02-02 00:25:58","**For further information as to how the process looked, to get to the official version of Prop 95, see the link to the Cosmos Hub Forum. Link to the Cosmos Hub forum discussion for prop 95:** https://forum.cosmos.network/t/funding-the-cosmos-hub-grant-program/8965/115

**Intro**

I‚Äôve been considering how we could make a more community oriented, grant funding initiative in response to Prop 95. I believe that this Prop should ask for much less, and should narrow their scope if it is to operate as a more centralized entity. Focus on funding R&amp;D, and coordinate new experimental functions. That is largely something that would be out of the scope of possibility, for the Community as a whole, to be able to do proper due diligence on. In my opinion, this would actually be a perfect fit for the team involved with Prop 95, as I personally believe they could excel at this role of ensuring R&amp;D is encouraged on the Hub, and proper due diligence is done on those requesting funds to perform said R&amp;D. However, there will be more on that, later in the post.

The topic that I have been really mulling over, as I‚Äôve been thinking about Prop 95, is how subDAOs may be able to play into a community oriented grant funding system. I have come to believe there may be many functions of grant funding that should be parted out, into treasury subDAOs with seperate mandates.

In fact, I would be much more prone to give out 588,000 ATOMs or even more, if these ATOMs weren‚Äôt all going to a single subDAO or entity. As well as, if this entity or subDAO, had specific guidelines and mandates on how it would operate with clear, transparent governance architecture and rules of operation for the subDAO. I feel like maybe the community might feel the same way.

**How could these treasury subDAOs work?**

An example, could be one subDAO fund that is dedicated to onboarding new projects/consumer chain funding for the Hub. We could allocate, just as an example, 100,000 ATOMs ($1,300,000 current value) to a specific subDAO, and the money would be controlled by the community and delegated voters. This subDAO would have a specific structure of Governance, that represents the community differently than the current treasury voting structure works. 

For example, hopeful new projects send in there pitchdeck to this subDAO, and the community has a month or so to approve or deny, rather than the current voting period of 2 weeks in the main Hub treasury. This month gives the project time to market their product, go have some interviews and explain its purpose or the projects features. All in all, they need to convince the community to accept their funding request. The best part, it‚Äôs all community controlled, and the subDAO can request additional funds from the treasury as much as it needs, if it needs more ATOMs to fund out. However, this leaves a check and balance of standard treasury dispersement. In other words, if the subDAO isn‚Äôt working as intended, then the Hub treasury doesn‚Äôt have to allocate its resources to the subDAO, and we can try something new. 

Over all, this serves the purpose of funding new projects and consumer chains, and the mandate in this specific subDAO could even be broadened out to supporting teams already growing the Hub as well. These teams can put together a pitch deck, explaining what they are building on the Hub, and apply for funding, as well as give examples of other features or projects they have built or helped build out on the Hub. A months worth of Due Diligence would be helpful in determining whether these teams deserve the requested funding, or if the community would rather save the resources for a different team or project. This specific objective, could also be the mandate of a subDAO, seperate from the new project subDAO as well. The point is, we can separate out these functions and implement different governance mechanisms, to make each subDAO more efficient and effective at certain objectives and mandates, if the community feels it‚Äôs necessary. 

In essence, these treasury subDAOs are similar to what we currently do in the Hubs treasury as it is today. However, Governance in its current form is not very efficient for treasury voting in my opinion. The two week Governance period isn‚Äôt long enough for proper due diligence from the community, so we somewhat instinctively vote no. Where as a longer time frame for due diligence would be beneficial in my opinion. Also there is an option in subDAO specific governance, to limit powerful validators and their voting power, to make sure one or multiple subDAOs are fully community driven. This could be a good distinction, in comparison to Hub governance and Hub treasury governance as it stands today.

**Conclusion**

In my opinion, a subDAO architecture, where this entity serves a specific mandate, set in stone by the community could be highly beneficial. It could be built with a seperate governance architecture that could be optimized for more ability for proper due diligence from the community, leading to a better and more efficient system than the current governance system is, regarding treasury Governance. 

It‚Äôs possible that multiple subDAO treasury initiatives could likely be a large step forward in the decentralization of the treasury. With the possibility of a variety of seperately mandated subDAOs, all community oriented, and governed in a way, to optimize best, for its specific mandate. 

Ultimately, I‚Äôd say my opinion on Prop 95, is that it needs broken up into a mixture of different entities. One side of these entities could be, one or multiple subDAOs with specific community mandates that must be followed. Otherwise, the Hub Treasury ought to deny further funding for this subDAO. 

The second would be an entity dedicated to technical specifics, and technical R&amp;D. This would entail, a specific grant fund with a smaller group of trusted individuals who we believe would do proper due diligence and would advance the Hub forward, using the funds provided from the Hub Treasury. The individuals in the current Prop 95, are likely individuals that I could agree with being controllers of this entity. And in this R&amp;D specific funding role, they would not need the 588,000 ATOMs, rather, they could operate on a much smaller budget and with more focus in one specific area of funding. 

More community involvement, more ability for due diligence and the ability too deploy capital from the treasury, in a more efficient manner. That‚Äôs what I think breaking up Prop 95 into one or multiple subDAOs and a R&amp;D centralized entity could provide. 

What is your opinion on subDAOs, and the breaking up of Prop 95 into multiple entities? Would you vote in favor of this sort of system over what Prop 95 advocates for?

"Mars Protocol; a deep dive.","JessicaLevi13","2023-02-01 18:18:44","Mars Protocol has launched its mainnet(Mars Hub).

Let‚Äôs learn about Mars, Mars v1, the rebirth of Mars into #Cosmos, Mars v2, $MARS token, token utility and $MARS airdropüëá.


‚ô¶Ô∏èWhat is Mars?

Mars is a novel interchain credit protocol primitive facilitating non-custodial borrowing and lending for the #Cosmos ecosystem.


‚ô¶Ô∏è Mars v1:

Mars v1 initially launched on #Terra, after the luna crash there was a need to move to another network.
The Cosmos #IBC prompted Mars rebirth into #Cosmos.

Mars protocol will operate on its own Cosmos-SDK appchain, Mars Hub. The hub will serve as a coordination mechanism in the background, while traders interact directly with the liquidity aggregated on each Mars outposts.


‚ô¶Ô∏è Mars v2:

Mars v2 develops a framework that enables you to long &amp; short assets, yield farm, lend/borrow, all with a single liquidation point. It is DeFi rebundled. It represents the next evolution in capital efficiency and UX for traders and yield farmers across Cosmos.


‚ô¶Ô∏è $MARS token:

$MARS is the token for the Mars Hub.

Previously on Terra, staked tokens were represented by $xMARS. But in Mars v2, the staked MARS will no longer be represented by $xMARS.
$MARS Stakers will earn protocol fees for securing the Mars Hub network.


‚ô¶Ô∏è $MARS Token Utility:

- Staking(i.e securing the chain).
- Governance.
- Earning fees: by staking $MARS, users will earn a share of the protocol fees.


‚ô¶Ô∏è $MARS Airdrop:

50 % of $MARS supply will be Airdropped to $MARS and $xMARS holders in Snapshot 1. And 50% will be airdropped to $MARS and $xMARS holders in Snapshot 2.

Snapshot 1: May 7, 2022. 11am EST.
Snapshot 2: May 28, 2022.


$MARS Holders as of Terra classic will be eligible to claim newly minted $MARS tokens on the Mars Hub.

The exchange for $MARS will be 1:1.
Whereas the exchange for $xMARS will be 1 $xMARS : 1.1 $MARS.","6","[""borrow and lending, so like Kava ?"",""&gt;Validators (aka **Martian Council**) and Stakers, who use $MARS coins to stake on the Mars Hub network, help manage **Outposts**, add new features, set risk parameters, and earn revenue from the revenues of the protocol.\r  \n\n\nSo, basic staking/lending/borrowing, but with \""cool\"" Mars names for everything?

"Important Update on SOMM Staking!","josh_acala","2023-02-01 02:55:03","Check out this forum post from Zaki on how SOMM staking rewards can be enabled for SOMM stakers. If there's support for this, it looks like it could be happening pretty soon. [https://community.sommelier.finance/t/proposal-for-community-pool-funding-of-somm-staking-rewards/1059](https://community.sommelier.finance/t/proposal-for-community-pool-funding-of-somm-staking-rewards/1059)

**Goal:**  
Launch staking rewards, subsidized by the Community Pool, while continuing to bootstrap TVL across a growing number of Cellars.

**Context:**  
Currently there are no opportunities for users to earn staking yield on their SOMM tokens. Sommelier‚Äôs tokenomic design allocates a portion of all Cellar fees to stakers and validators (.225% TVL). However, SOMM staking yields have been constrained by Cellar TVL, which hasn‚Äôt yet reached the point at which it can provide competitive APYs.

Temporarily subsidizing Cellar fees from the Community Pool to provide competitive staking rewards should create more awareness for Sommelier, incentivize new user growth, and improve security. As more users generate higher commissions for validators, new validators may be incentivized to join the network, further increasing decentralization. Additionally, higher commissions for validators will help support one of Sommelier‚Äôs main 2023 goals: multi-chain strategies. Supporting multiple chains comes with an additional cost to validators and subsidized staking rewards will partially offset the cost of supporting multiple chains.

Credit to [@poldsam](https://community.sommelier.finance/u/poldsam) for figuring out how to thread this needle.

These subsidies are designed to be in place only temporarily, while total value locked (TVL) grows across an increasing number of Cellars. After a period of roughly one year, the subsidies will be re-evaluated depending on the amount of bootstrapping needed to achieve competitive yields via Cellar fees alone.

These rewards would be distributed out of the Community Pool. There would be no change to token supply as a result of this proposal and these rewards are all non-inflationary.

**Proposal:**  
This proposal would activate staking incentives funded by the community pool via the new incentives module: [sommelier/x/incentives at main ¬∑ PeggyJV/sommelier ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/PeggyJV/sommelier/tree/main/x/incentives)

This proposal will adjust two parameters, ‚ÄúDistributionPerBlock‚Äù and ‚ÄúIncentivesCuttoffHeight"". These parameters control how much SOMM is distributed to stakers every block from the community pool and at what block height these incentives will cease respectively.  
If approved, the proposal will set the DistributionPerBlock parameter to \~2.0 (rather than 0) and set the IncentivesCuttoffHeight to approximately 5M blocks, or a block height approximately one year away. This will enable distribution of the specified number of SOMM per block until the chain reaches the specified block height in approximately one year.

If 100% of the circulating supply are staked, stakers could expect an APY of \~10%. However, we believe we could see APYs +50%, using more realistic staking rate assumptions.

**Funding:**  
Up to 10M SOMM, or \~7% of the current community pool, would be used to temporarily subsidize staking rewards for the period of one year. The exact amount of SOMM to be distributed is hard to know in advance, as it depends on block height, but variance is not expected to be greater than 30,000 SOMM.

**Conclusion:**  
In this post we outlined a proposal to subsidize staking rewards through the community pool. We believe this is a critical step in bootstrapping the growth of the Sommelier network.

We would appreciate any feedback on how to ensure the proposal best reflects the interests of the Sommelier protocol and community.","8","[""Somms cellars are dope. I have a no vpn stance but feel like breaking it to get in on one or two of these strats. \n\nSomm up 32% on 24 hr. nice.""]"

Also, we need more entities asking for grant funds, we need to build out the Cosmos Hub and it‚Äôs consumer chains while the bear market is ongoing, so when the Bull market comes around, we can blow the crypto market away with how effective and efficient our ecosystem is. However, viewpoints like ‚Äúthe Hub will become irrelevant, if this prop doesn‚Äôt pass‚Äù are misguided. The Hub will highly likely never become irrelevant, but it ABSOLUTELY CAN, fall short in terms of meeting its potential if, we don‚Äôt start allocating resources. Just food for thought. We need to figure out resource allocation as a community, and quit relying on the ICF, Informal or other dedicated organizations to do it for us, and then get mad when they put together a prop or grant fund we don‚Äôt like. We should be contributing proactively, not reactively.

This means there are indeed limits to how many chains can tether to Polkadot.\n\nHowever, this design isn't without its benefits. For one thing, the entire ecosystem inherits the security of Polkadot's relay chain, meaning that parachains are securer than otherwise. Polkadot also has some pretty clever economics underpinning the allocation of resources to parachains and parathreads.\n\nOver time the technology will advance (with sharding, etc), theoretically meaning that network capacity stays proportional to demand for parachain slots.\n\nOne final consideration is that some scarcity is good from a Darwinian perspective. Networks must compete both to secure a parachain slot and to continue leasing it. This forms an ecosystem that optimises for quality."",""Cosmos can have infinite chains that can be 100% independent from Cosmos Hub and ATOM. (Non ICS).\nHowever they will soon be capable of using ICS which is similar to DOT.\n\nPolkadot can have only 100 that rely heavily in DOT token. No trully independent chains."",""&gt;Let‚Äôs suppose that the cosmos ecosystem suddenly gets x1000 new chains over night, it wouldn‚Äôt be no problem for the the cosmos network, right?\n\nIf the x1000 chains are independent/sovereign (as they currently are in Cosmos network) then each of them will have their own scalability configuration and outputs (much like it is today).\n\nIf the x1000 chains will want to be part of the Inter-Chain security, then scalability will suffer, since Inter-Chain security will simply require to increase the hardware (\""power\"") that each validator has.\n\nThe difference in Polkadot is that validator's main job is to secure the entire ecosystem, it is not a secondary job (on top of validating a specific hub/zone chain). Once the requirements go up, in theory if all other factors remain static,  the security of IBC goes down.\n\nI personally like the idea of Cosmos and definitely IBC is a great product, however, ICS in its current design will not increase scalability of the network, but rather hamper it in the long term. Hopefully changes will be implemented.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, keep in mind, something like \""shared security\"" cannot be baked into a protocol after the fact, it has to be its foundation, otherwise it is a secondary requirement, therefore it cannot be the main security provider. That is one of the main differences between Cosmos and Polkadot.\n\nCosmos took a top-down approach/development strategy, where the Cosmos Hub was first designed, then each Comos SDK chain simply copy-pasted it and customized it after the fact.  This made it easier for projects to build on, since there were less \""rules to follow\"", however this also means that it overall reduces the overall security of the ecosystem (from a technical perspective). In IBC connected Cosmos, the ecosystem is as strong as its weakest link.\n\nPolakdot took a bottom-up approach/development strategy, where the Polkadot Relay Chain took years to build the foundation, upon which other chains had to integrate in (especially in the case of parachains). This made it harder for projects to build on top of it, but it also provided all projects with the same security guarantee.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Layman Terms:  \nIn Cosmos you still need to find and FUND your validator set, for your own chain (which costs money one way or another, be it upfront, long-term economic incentives provided via your chain tokenomics or renting validators via ICS).\n\nIn Polkadot you need no validators to start your chain, Relay Chain validators provide security for your chain, however you need to obtain a parachain slot (which again means cost), so then you as a project can just concentrate on building the application layer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth approaches have their positives and negatives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps"",""In terms of [Paul Baran's network diagrams](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rene_Dettenborn/publication/340347391/figure/fig2/AS:875495654707200@1585745838033/Diagrams-of-networks-by-Paul-Baran-Source-Baran-4.ppm), Polkadot is centralized in the relay chain, and Cosmos is distributed.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, [look at Polkadot's own diagrams](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/99add259d16a8477448562f8b0317f08.png), then take a look at [Map of Zones](https://mapofzones.com/) in comparison."",""ics cannot scale, as more chains are added to the validators the hardware requirements go up, see here \n\nhttps://forum.polkadot.network/t/what-are-some-differences-between-substrate-and-cosmos-sdk/1354"",""I see the cosmos hub as a future ‚ÄúS Tier‚Äù security chain, a mid off dozens/thousands of new security chains that will appear. \n\nThe ideia of creating an ecosystem that doesn‚Äôt rely on a ‚Äúcentral token‚Äù or network, therefore it can be infinitely scalable, has its costs. In this case, the Cosmos Hub will always have to be competitive in its own ecosystem, under the penalty of being irrelevant. \n\nThat is called a truly free market! An ecosystem that allows every single chain to communicate between each other and to keep the ideia of sovereignty, in which the app chains are going to have its own model of security, request interchain security from other app chains or share mesh security."",""Cosmos is Android and Polkadot is iOS"",""Indeed, scalability affects growth.

Basically, for validators who wish to run their own validator as a brand, earn commissions, but prefer not to run the actual machine and take the risk associated with running that machine, they will hire out this service of machine running to someone like All Nodes or Figment. In this scenario white label providing, these providers are taking on the risk associated with validation. They will make sure upgrades are timely, ensure there is no downtime, and manage the risk of jailing and slashing. They also provide insurance for jailing and slashing as well, in the case that they make a mistake that requires a payout of such insurance.

So, the issue with this service is, when these validators, who are receiving this white label providing service, give over there validating duties to these white label providers, the service provider, must also have control over the validator in questions private keys. To my knowledge, there is currently no way for these providers to provide this validating service, without having access to the private keys of the *official* validator. So in other words when you stake, to a validator who is outsourcing to a white label provider, this validator is trusting them with their private key.

**cough cough**, Not your keys, Not your validator, **cough cough**.

The most basic premise of security in crypto is, never share your private key with anyone. That is in fact, what these validators are doing with respect to All Node, Figment or any other white label provider.

***Why is this a risk?***

First, I'll let Notional answer, then I will give an example and reasoning why this could get even more prominent on the Cosmos Hub.

""What are the possible impacts?

* Allnodes can impersonate validators because they have the seed phrases
* Allnodes can halt lunc because they control &gt;33% of VotePower
* Allnodes can spend from the validator operator wallets
* Allnodes can participate in governance as their clients
* At 66% of VotePower, IBC fraud becomes possible.  Allnodes is at around 41% currently. But we really don‚Äôt know how much vp (voting power) they have.  They refuse to release their client list""

This could be a long shot, but long shots tend to happen more often than we‚Äôd like to think. Imagine a world, where All Node validator is corrupted in some way, and they decide to start taking control of the voting power of several of these validators? This could be a huge addition to their power within the Cosmos. That is a massive systemic risk that could arise from this trend of white label providing, and in my opinion, we need to fight against this in every way possible. Sure we could just redelegate, hopefully before a catastrophy of some sort, however, is this really a risk we want to run?

This becomes more realistic and, generally more likely, with the coming complexity added for validators, stimming from Interchain Security. In the future, it may be very possible to see white label providing, gain in popularity, depending on the location, technical and financial capabilities of lower placed validators. This is exactly what needs to be fought against now, and not in the late stages of this trend. Imagine giving a few white list providing entities, 66% of the validator keys. Because if that were to happen, it is fork or nothing, and with Interchain security being implemented, forking the Hub will be a large and likely much more complicated task.

***How do we mitigate this risk?***

Really, the best solution, is to delegate the majority, if not all of your stake, to independent operaters. The threat of white label providers centralizing the network is way too damn high, and we have to disincentivize this behavior. So I will have below, the full list of Luna validators, who are known to be compromised by All Nodes. *If you stake LUNC with any of these validators, restake immediately. This is not a drill!*

***Compromised validators***

* BetterLunc
* LUNC808
* MrDiamondhandz1
* HappyCatKripto
* lunc\_nymph
* davidagoebelt
* ClassyCrypto\_
* CryptoKing\_NFT
* Asobs\_CNG
* Toxic Labs
* Allnodes (The one who has formally agreed to allow for this risk to occur. That 0% fee you love so much, is subsidized by systemic risk to network security.)

If you don't own LUNC, you aren't safe. Get the hell away from All-nodes and any white label provider or any validator that is known to be white label provided! We have to nip this trend in the butt, as a community. This is our responsibility in blockchain, we get paid staking rewards to contribute to network security, so do your part and lets encourage best validator practice, effective immediately.

\*\*\*Conclusion

Validator key centralization is a freaking massive deal people, like I really cannot express what this could do to networks in the Cosmos Eco, but most specifically the Hub. This service may pick up steam drastically, as the need for a tighter, more technically robust validator set comes into play due to Interchain Security.

You know how bridges get hacked, when the multi-sig signers lose their private keys, and then that attacker sends all of the funds to their wallet and it costs a few hundred million dollars worth of value from innocent people? I wonder what that would look like, of All Nodes controlled multiple validators worth a few million ATOMS, and wherever they are holding their clients keys at, gets compromised? Then suddenly a malicious party controls a large part of the Cosmos Hubs voting power. What if white label providing became so popular, that a select few white label providers controlled 67% of the network? Hopefully those providers aren't holding those keys, in an insecure location. I mean, just 34% of malicious validators is enough to cause a halt. And 67% simply forms a new consensus. Is that possible as a validators job gets harder and white label providing becomes a more popular solution for lower bound validators? There are even more pronounced possibilities, if these white label providers control a high number of validators and voting power,and they suffer a crack down by the US feds, or they straight up suffer eminent domain and the validators are seized by the Government ""for the pretection of the people"" or some bull shit. These are legitimate possibilities, and this type of risk, with the centralization of keys and validator centralization, stimming from white label providing, is at the forefront.

Take the initiative, and redelegate from All Nodes, send this message that we want to step away from this type of validator service model. I will be doing research for white label provided validators, and if I am able to find some, I will make sure to make another post about those as well. If you know of a white label provided validator, please comment on this post so I can edit it in! We should send them to the bottom of the set, if not out of the active set. We should take this time to push up the independent operating validators. They are already doing their job, straight up, without the need to compromise their keys, and in turn, the network.

Some validators I believe are independant operators (please correct me on any I am wrong about), who you could redelegate too:

* Notional
* Chorus One
* Informal Systems
* Citadel One
* ~~Imperator~~ (White Label Provider)
* iqlusion
* Strange-love
* B-harvest
* Polkachu
* Audit.one
* Smart nodes
* Lavender.five Nodes
* Golden ratio staking
* Oni
* Whisper Nodes
* ~~Binary Holdings~~  (White Label Provider)
* Pupmos
* Stargaze
* coinhall.org
* Cosmic Validator
* Architect Nodes
* NosNodes
* Getcoldy

Have any validators who are independent, that you want added? Please let me know, I am happy to add them, or make a future post with a list of ***trusted, independent and machine operating validators*** for us all to encourage, support and incentivize, as their lives get inevitably harder due to our favorite upcoming addition to the Cosmos stack, Interchain security. I love ICS, but dang it, why does every good thing have a trade-off.

Warning for holders of SCRT","22","[""This was written by the founder of secret and I appreciate how thorough and explanatory it is. I like the solution presented and I‚Äôm not concerned at this point. However, that being said‚Ä¶ FUCK TOR UP HIS ASS"",""The Secret Foundation was created to support the expanding Secret Network community and pledged to operate transparently and with good governance as a non-profit organization. Initially, the foundation was intended to have a responsible board of directors to ensure accountability, a compensation committee, and regular financial statements and annual audits conducted by an independent third party, however, these measures were never implemented.\nAs time passed, the community began to notice that the foundation isn‚Äôt fulfilling its promise of good governance. Complaints from community members increased and they demanded that measures be put in place to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of funds. Several actions were taken by the community to push for transparency, including¬†proposal 103¬†2¬†which received 88.78% approval. Despite these calls for transparency, the Secret Foundation continued to make promises to operate in a more transparent manner but failed to follow through on them.\nRecently, the situation reached a boiling point as some community members made serious allegations against Tor and the Secret Foundation, accusing them of lacking transparency and mishandling funds, hiding the true nature of their financial activity from the community. The situation became so dire that personal intimidation was reported, and SCRT Labs had to intervene to help diffuse the situation. At the same time, further incidents came to light, specifically regarding the mismanagement of funds in an OTC deal conducted by the Foundation, which resulted in the loss of ~$250K in funds ‚Äì an incident that was left unreported for over a year and a half and SCRT Labs had no knowledge of.\nAs a result of these events, it became necessary to re-examine the current and future structure of the Secret Foundation. This led to a series of calls with Tor, the Founder and the most senior officer at the organization, during which additional information came to light that we felt we could not ethically ignore and had to bring to the attention of the community.\nTo the best of our understanding, the following has occurred in late 2021:\n\nSecret Foundation sold a substantial amount of USD worth of SCRT.\n\nTor cashed out a significant portion of these proceeds (to the best of our understanding, a figure in the low-to-mid seven figures) as a dividend.\n\nThis action was not disclosed in any financial reports provided to the community by the Foundation, which was introduced by Tor as a non-profit organization on several occasions. In particular, the Q4 2021 report indicates a cash inflow of ~$4m for SF, but does not mention this withdrawal.\n\nIn addition, there are potentially other unreported financial irregularities, such as an open loan to Alameda or one of its affiliates by the Secret Foundation. To the best of our knowledge, the loan or its lack of repayment have not been disclosed to the community in any of the reports.\nIn our opinion, these actions seriously undermine the community‚Äôs trust in Tor and as a result, of the Secret Foundation, and it reinforces the demand of the community to have a truly open, transparent and accountable Secret Foundation organization that acts in accordance with its mandate.\nTherefore, our suggestion is to work with the community to structure a new Secret Foundation that operates as advertised, and as a network of Secret‚Äôs magnitude deserves. The initial blueprint we suggest is:\n\nAll current funds held by Secret Foundation (In both crypto and fiat) to be returned to the community and to serve as the basis for a new and improved organization, which will be formed under new leadership.\n\nThe new organization will be comprised of current Secret Foundation employees, along with Secret Agency members, and will be registered as a non-profit and will maintain a transparent and audited activity.\n\nIn the first few months (and perhaps longer - assuming funds permit), this new organization will utilize the funds returned to the community. Long-term, it will submit annual funding requests to the chain with a clear budget, milestones, and asks.\n\nWe will work with the community to establish a strong Board of Directors, including an executive director, comprised of industry leaders. Similarly, we will look to build a Technical Advisory Board to help steward the network into the Secret 2.0 era.\n\nAs a community-driven organization, it is important that we hold those in leadership positions to the highest standards of transparency and compliance. We understand that this issue needs to be addressed in order to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the Secret ecosystem.\nAs a final note, we‚Äôd like to say that while we raise and acknowledge these concerns, we are at the same time very optimistic about the future. The Secret community is well-equipped to address the necessary changes, and this restructuring will help the platform reach new heights as we work towards our Secret 2.0 vision. We have great community members and contributors, incredible and well-intentioned employees of Secret Agency and the current Secret Foundation, and with such a force, there‚Äôs really no obstacle we cannot overcome together!\n‚Äì SCRT Labs"",""You guys need to integrate monero into secret.

"Centralization risk vectors that arise from Interchain Security. Why redelegating now, and supporting lower validators is going to be critical once Interchain Security starts ramping up.","Jcook_14","2023-01-27 16:05:30","***What risks pop up from Interchain Security?***

Like everyone else, I am extremely excited for Interchain Security and the amazing value proposition that could come from consumer chains leveraging the Cosmos Hubs validator set. This service provided by the Hub, could provide massive amounts of value, for the Hub and is an extremely valuable service for the consumer chains, as it makes spinning up a chain, that much easier with not having to search for their own validator set.

However, to understand what risks come from Interchain Security, you must know alittle more about how it will operate in respect to validators. You see, every consumer chain, will inevitably require a new node, or machine to validate that new consumer chain. These extra machines are extra work for each validator, which could very well mean more employees to help run the validator appropriately as to not get slashed or jailed. This machine will also mean, more electrical costs, and additional general compute costs that come from running a node. Some estimates according to the Cosmos Hub forum that I will link below, states that the additional expense load, could vary widely, between $100-$600 per month depending on a validators rig setup, electrical cost and the cost of their service providers for the additional computing of each additional chain. 

Below is a link to the forum post, that made me want to begin this discussion here. We need to pull the alarm bell about the necessity of small validators remaining profitable, and the best way to do this is through delegating some of your stake to multiple smaller validators. Otherwise we risk large scale validators beginning to swallow up these smaller validators and their stake, due to the additional costs and inability to remain profitable.

**Link to the forum**- https://forum.cosmos.network/t/preparing-for-replicated-security/8925/31

***What could this centralization look like?***

The way this centralization could come about is largely two fold.

1. Large scale validators could buy up these smaller validators and their brands, to bring them under their parent company. While keeping the original branding and that was acquired from the previous validator, to seem as if, these are not the same entity. However, this trend could get scary if large scale validators start acquiring the unprofitable validators, as this could have serious implications if many of the validators are controlled by a few central entities.

2. The second threat would be, rather than sell, these smaller validators could opt to keep their branding and outsource their validator machines and share the keys, with a larger entity whose able to handle the additional load and work added. To my knowledge, the term for a validator who provides this service is a ""white label provider"". 

For those not aware of the All-Nodes saga, an issue *supposedly* (I have not followed the situation closely, but have gotten bits and pieces of what is going on) being dealt with in the Cosmos right now. There are a few validators on the Cosmos Hub, who use All-Nodes as their white label provider, while the main team behind the validator control the Governance and branding. This is an issue because if these keys have been shared with All-Nodes, is this really their validator? Not your keys, not your validator, as they may say. 

This could become a growing trend, as the need for smaller validators who have already have a brand and delegators, may end up outsourcing their machines and sharing their keys to a white label provider, to ensure they can remain profitable. They would do this, to take off much of the additional expense coming from the additional nodes, making an indirect centralization through key sharing and machine centralization. 

***Where do we go from here, knowing that these centralization threats are becoming ever more present as Interchain Security arrives?***

We need to focus ourselves, as delegators and really put in the research into the validators we delegate too. Ideally, we will not support white label provider validators, nearly as much as we support primary operators. Primary operators (especially the ones who pay attention to Governance, and vote) are going through the process of validating, in the right way. They are working for your delegation and working for your commission, so long as they stay reliable, these primary operating validators should absolutely have your stake, not a brand who outsources the work.

We should also focus our delegations on teams that audit, code and build within the ecosystem. Why give your staking reward commission to a team that does nothing with the funds you're giving them? Don't waste your commission, even if you have to pay alittle more, pay those who audit, code or build. There is no reason to throw away perfectly good money. Many teams outside of the top 10 are absolute beasts, when it comes to auditing, coding , building, ecosystem support, general bug fixes and so much more that has to do with laying out good infrastructure in the Cosmos ecosystem. Do your research, find the validators who deserve your stake, and avoid the ones who simply want to sell your commission.

Lastly, it should be obvious by now, but I will continue to say it. Delegate the majority of your stake to mid to low ranked validators. We as a community of delegators, have the duty of responsible delegation. That means, do not delegate in the top 10 of the cosmos Hub and delegate to the people who are building out the Cosmos. Is your validator building with your commission, or are they dumping? Is your validator a relayer, or do they just simply validate that chain while not contributing to the interoperability of the Ecosystem and funstionality of the IBC? Find the validators who are truly important to the Cosmos, and delegate to them. 

***Conclsuion***

We as delegators have a choice to make. DO we sit idle and ignore the centralization threat at hand, or do we do our research and move our stake into validtaors that promote decentralization and help to build the Cosmos. Interchain Security is extremely bullish, we should all be very excited to see it approaching fast. However, blockchain, like life, is a game of trade-offs. We seem to be be trading off some of our decentralization, for the ease of spinning up a new sovereign blockchain. Time will tell how much this will truly effect decentralization, but doing our part immediately, by redelegating to those primary operators who are contributing to the Cosmos, could truly change the trajectory to remain meaningfully decentralized.","10","[""Curious to see how the different validators handle the extra work of consumer chains. \n\n\nObviously the core contributors and relayers will handle it fine, but curious how what i call the corporate validators, the ones who validate on most POS chains handle the work. \n\n\nI would recommend we manage our expectations of ICS in the coming months. If it's smooth great. If it takes awhile to iron out the kinks be ready. Given how many validators are aligned with Jae we should also be ready for a sneak attack. \n\n\nAnd if you don't have a big bag of Atom I wouldn't expect amazing rewards out of ICS. I have a decent bag and i'm not expecting much. Inflation isn't changing anytime soon though so we got that going for us.""]"

Hi, Cosmonauts! Of course, you should know the advantages of hardware wallets. The primary benefit is probably that private key remains off-chain and out of reach for fraudsters. And CoolWallet is one of that kind. Its feature is a smooth BlueTooth connection highly secured with military-grade - AES 256 (Evaluation Assurance Level for IT products) 

Our team has prepared a fresh step-by-step guide on [**How to Stake Cosmos (ATOM) using CoolWallet**](https://everstake.one/blog/how-to-stake-cosmos-atom-using-coolwallet)

What's inside:

‚óæÔ∏è What is CoolWallet?

If bitcoin is to adopt zk proof tech regular ibc could work but there would still need a lot of changes and even then i don't know would it be possible.

I was just checking through the Cosmos Hub Forum not too long ago, and was reading from the discussion (linked below), about the recent ICA/Quicksilver bug and it‚Äôs fix. However, the last part of the thread is actually Jehan with Informal systems giving an updated timeline on the upcoming proposals and upgrades to the Hub, and his timeline for ICS is:

    ""After the RS (Replicated Security) persistent testnet has tested everything to our satisfaction after 2 weeks (it will continue running after this, hence ‚Äúpersistent‚Äù), we will start the release testnet for v9. The upgrade from v8 to v9 in the release testnet will take 3 days, after which the voting period is 2 weeks.
    
    All told, we are currently projecting a go live date of February 22nd for Gaia v9 with replicated security.""

"When are Atom's Tokenomics Going to Be Improved?","TheMaskedBallsack","2023-01-26 10:04:07","Everyone, including core devs, think Atom's tokenomics, are not ideal (to say the least). This was the aspect I was most looking forward to with ATOM 2.0.

We don‚Äôt want to gamble too much on ICS, as to where it shoots stakers in the foot, if ICS doesn‚Äôt hit the ground running in the amount of time we‚Äôd like. Inflation is not sustainable in its current form, we‚Äôre basically all in agreement on that. I personally just want to see ICS and the projects ATOM secures, really get momentum, and then we can really have a meaningful discussion on inflation. \n\nAs for ATOM 2.0, we should re-evaluate that proposal, but in multiple proposals breaking down each item in full detail, then we can vote on those seperate proposals. ATOM 2.0 wasn‚Äôt bad, however it was a case of too much signaling at one time. Most people like the Scheduler and allocator, most people like inflation reduction, but we don‚Äôt need it all put together in one proposal. There were some issues like the inflation going to the treasury, when we can do that through various taxes that would do much less harm to holders in the short term IMO. These proposals can be seperated out and debated individually and it will just as, if not more effective as Prop 82. As it stands, I‚Äôm happy that prop 82 was rejected. However, I‚Äôm excited for the seperate well thought out and highly discussed proposals that should come out of it. We want a new vision, it just wasn‚Äôt that one."",""When? Maybe when Jae Kwon stops holding the chain hostage.\n\nSeriously, though, hopefully he won't try to stick his dick in the gears of any ICS proposals and we can move forward from there, with ICS revenue taking the place of some ATOM staking rewards."",""I would be okay with inflation going down to 7 and pay cut down to 13 still would like atom as a reward""]"

"Question on Nomic‚Äôs attack vectors","Jcook_14","2023-01-26 03:51:09","So I know that instead of being a bridge, based strictly off of a multisig, I know the validators will have a large part to play in making Nomic way more secure than a traditional bridge. However, in this model, is the main attack vector then, the private keys on the Bitcoin side of the bridge? Or is there, in someway, going to be a multisig where the validators actually sign the transactions and hold the private keys, making a hack on the Bitcoin side much less likely than in a traditional bridge? The architecture on the Bitcoin side is what I get hung up on, when thinking of the bridge risk associated with Nomic. 

Any info or resources are much appreciated.

***Edited in answer:***  A reserve of Bitcoin is maintained in a decentralized way through use of a special multisig contract. No individuals in the network are given custody of the Bitcoin in reserves, but instead the collective whole cooperates to hold or disburse funds. The validators of the sidechain network become signatories of the reserve, since their signatures are required to control the funds on the Bitcoin blockchain.

To disburse funds from the reserve, more than two-thirds of the signatory set must sign the Bitcoin transaction (weighted by voting power). This is enforced on the Bitcoin blockchain through the ""reserve script"". Using the ""Taproot"" family of features on Bitcoin, we can create a reserve script scheme which only requires the on-chain size of a typical single-signature payment input and lets us support up to 1,000 signatories.

"Cosmos Check-In #10","satriapamudji","2023-01-25 20:33:40","Hey Cosmonauts, here is your tenth check-in! For those who were celebrating Lunar New Year, I hope you had a good break and celebration. This week‚Äôs market was fabulous as the Lunar New Year (surprisingly) always lead to a short term bull run ‚Äî most likely due to the risk appetite from the Asia Markets increasing dramatically with the combination of the celebrations from end of Q4.

But anyway, we‚Äôre here to talk about Cosmos‚Ä¶ so let‚Äôs dive right in!

If you‚Äôre new to these check-ins, the goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 10 minutes every week!

So, grab a coffee and let‚Äôs dive in.

**‚û§ Biggest news of the week**

The biggest news of this week has to be the listing of Kava Network on Coinbase. Now, for those who are not familiar with Coinbase; Coinbase is the largest US cryptocurrency exchange and it is typically the first point of contact for people who are trying to get into Web3.

In the past, listing on Coinbase has been a major challenge for IBC projects due to technical limitations. Thankfully, due to the work that has been put in by Kava Network, the time for listing is now decreased dramatically, from more than 18 months to 1 month ‚Äî which potentially means that we will see more IBC projects listing on Coinbase.

**‚û§ Tangible upgrades and launches**

This week, several updates and launches have been made in the Cosmos ecosystem.

1. Osmosis has upgraded to v14 ‚Äî termed as the Neon Upgrade and introduces new features such as gTWAP, Downtime Detection module &amp; IBC 4.2.0
2. Gno Land starts the Game of Realms, with a prize pool of 133,700 ATOMs. This is focused on getting developers familiar with gnolang, on board to Gno Land.
3. Keplr has shipped out one of the most wanted and probably also needed feature, which allows users to view and unview chains, and this is customizable.
4. Astroport is now on testnet on Injective, and this marks the starts of the three phases of Astroport‚Äôs launch, with the next one opening up this testnet to the public.
5. After the first Cosmos‚Äô M&amp;A occured, Wynd DAO wanted to build Wynd DEX. 10 weeks later, Wynd DEX is now out, and is now the biggest DEX on JUNO.
6. Other minor update includes Cronos‚Äô integration with Tenderly, Arable‚Äôs IBC update and Kujira‚Äôs Senate finalization.

**‚û§ Non-tangible upgrades and proposals**

Next, we look at the non-tangible upgrades, which includes some exciting proposals that are either already on-chain and in the voting process, or will be up for voting in the upcoming days.

1. Lum Network‚Äôs Proposal 36 will upgrade Lum Network from v1.3.0 to v1.3.1, which prunes a few problems, such as the problem with DFract Module.
2. Soon, we will most likely see arUSD live on Osmosis, which is an over-collateralized stablecoin and gives arUSD holders rewards from operating profits.
3. In the next few weeks, proposals on Canto will be rolled out to introduce Contract Secured Revenue (CSR), which is a fee-splitting model for the Canto network
4. Mars Outposts which will also be launched in February, this enable users to leverage yield farm vault positions and farm with leverage for increased yield.

‚û§ **Other interesting happenings**

* One of the more subtle developments that has been brewing is Interchain NFTs, and this Twitter Thread by Interchain explains how it will impact the future.
* How has the crypto market size changed over the past year? Crypto.com‚Äôs Market Sizing report answers this, through their report which was released this week.
* Secret Network has released their ‚ÄúSecret Learn Portal‚Äù ‚Äî which includes informative content about everything related to Secret Network and how to get started.

**Wrapping it all up**

That marks the end of week 10, and once again, for those celebrating Lunar New Year ‚Äî hope you enjoy it fully! Stay safe in these market conditions, and don‚Äôt get too greedy.

In order to reach ETH market cap at some point, we will need ETH level of adoption during the next bull run.","16","[""I believe as more people come to the realization that eth is far more centralized as a pos chain not to mention how its a L1 chain that they literally try to build everything on. More projects that have their origins on eth like dydx will end up building their own layer 1s using dot or cosmos.  Having their own L1 give‚Äôs their token more utility and alleviates any scalability issues they had when building on eth.  The app chain thesis i believe will more then prove itself as the foundation of web 3.  An internet of blockchains that all are interconnected. With IBC the new chains shouldn‚Äôt have issues with onboarding users and liquidity.  Eth will likely loose more and more L2 projects and roll ups that decide to build their own chain with their own validation and security.  Eth has scalability issues because it‚Äôs got 100s of projects on it fighting for blockspace.  Many projects that could very successfully create their own chains.  Time will tell, but if you ask me cosmos chains will dominate the crypto space and cause eth to either enable ibc and play nice with everyone else or slowly bleed off projects old and new alike."",""Provenance Blockchain (HASH) is using the Cosmos SDK for lending &amp; financial services. It's been online for some time now and actively processing transactions for large financial institutions (Apollo, Novawolf, Jefferies, etc.). Looks like they want to launch a stablecoin with FDIC banks in the near future."",""Well, I believe that big businesses are embracing crypto projects such as FET, OCEAN, and MATIC. Polygon was recently accepted into Disney's program, while FetchAI and Ocean Protocol are AI projects gaining traction with big businesses.

I will just paste content from one of my posts.\n\n**Enterprise (Consortium) Blockchain;**  IBC is also beneficial in the enterprise space because of its trust-minimized way of interoperability. For now, there are light clients for Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Besu (IBFT 2.0 consensus) and Corda, which account for a large percentage of blockchains used in the enterprise space. Datachain is a core contributor to those light clients and teamed up with Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Bank, one of the largest banks in Japan, to realize interoperability between Quorum and Corda using IBC."",""first of all, they put things in order, put them on the air and then connect to themselves in Cosmos And co and various other net networks"",""Big guys are not - in fact - using Ethereum for anything because it's still an expensive convoluted mess of a chain.\n\nIf you are looking for real institutional interest look at Quant.\n\nNot sure where this adoption meme came from - a lot of stuff on Ethereum is created to fleece the retail, no one serious touches it as it's more expensive than traditional web or finance - you'll find that most people shilling it are the ones that got in early and can AFFORD to use it. It's the most well capitalized to PAY FOR ADOPTION and has been here the longest as far as smart contract chains go but don't mistake ACTUAL adoption for ETH SPONSORED adoption.\n\nin 99% of cases the chains PAY FOR ADOPTION - institutions don't just 'choose' them."",""What‚Äôs also interesting about eth is the actual positions held by the top wallets.  I remember early on when I started investing into alts every one said to not invest in a project if a few top wallets held a certain %.  Eth has some of the largest whales in the crypto space. I don‚Äôt like liquid staking they developed on eth either.  Liquid staking feels like a gimmick to accumulate enough of the real token to make themselves a dominant validator on the chain.   They give you a fake version of the real thing that you can only use on select DeFi projects ran by the liquid staking team.  Usually a liquidity pool with the real coin and pays you in a farm token with an apr close to what you would get if you just stake with any other validator.  It sounds to good to be true, and I think it‚Äôs a power play for governance and not an actual benefit to any chain that wants to claim they are decentralized."",""Are there actually any services in the Cosmos ecosystem outside of DeFi?

IBC is a great piece of tech. Also, the chains available are extremely useful such as Osmosis, Juno, and Kujira. Future chains like penumbra, DYDX, and more will also be coming and sometimes through staking ATOM (and others such as JUNO &amp; OSMO) you can receive airdrops from great projects. Lastly, the community is great and it feels like everyone is truly interested in building and participating in a sustainable decentralized ecosystem."",""Airdrops, High APR, easily and seamlessly swap between many other blockchains, amazing UI, awesome space branding.\n\nJust use osmosis and swap some coins and see how nice it is to use. Once I used osmosis I fell in love, I just stay in cosmos."",""When it comes to be the Cosmos ecosystem, there isn‚Äôt a better UX out there. There is a mix of App chains and smart contracting platforms, with a blossoming Defi ecosystem, all seamlessly interoperable with each other. There‚Äôs a ton being built, however almost none of it derives value to the Cosmos Hub (ATOM). The Cosmos Hub, unto this point has derived value through the Network effect, of sovereign blockchains joining the network or airdropping their tokens. It also has derived value through high staking APR‚Äôs. \n\nThe next iteration of the Cosmos Hubs value accrual will be through Interchain Security (replicated security). I recommend looking up a few videos or searching this sub for posts on the mat specific topic. A quick rundown on what Interchain Security will be, is where sovereign blockchains can lease the Cosmos Hubs validator set, to secure their network rather than going and getting their own validator set, effectively gaining the same economic security that the Cosmos Hub has. In turn, these chains will pay the Cosmos Hubs validators and delegators staking rewards, paid for in their own native staking token. This has the ability to give serious value accrual to the Cosmos Hub, through new passive rewards paid to delegators, depending on how many chains utilize Interchain security. \n\nI highly recommend looking up Cryptocito, when he interviews Devs like Jehan, Jack Zampolin, Zaki, Sunny and Jae Kwon. All of these different perspectives give a great overview of the tech being built, different visions and ideologies for the Cosmos Hub and Cosmos/IBC ecosystem as a whole. There‚Äôs great content out there if you‚Äôre wanting to get in depth. I also recommend looking up medium articles, Interchain FM (Medium and YouTube). Depending on your technical understanding of blockchain, there is a massive amount of resources out there to DYOR. Hope this helps."",""Fast, cheap, and user friendly. The DEX‚Äôs in the Cosmos ecosystem are the most Noob-friendly of any DEX in crypto imo."",""What makes cosmos truly unique is the low barrier to entry and full customization for developers. No L1 will ever be sufficient for scaling to mass adoption/web3 tps. It's much easier and cheaper to spin up a cosmos chain than to launch an L2 or DOT parachain and there is a lot more independence and customization than using a L1 or L2 that is shared by other projects with different needs. Yet a Cosmos chain has IBC interoperability to all the other IBC chains, plus whatever bridges are developed to any of those other chains.\n\nCosmos is perfect for low budget start ups and custom and experimental projects. That's why it has attracted some very unique and interesting projects that can't be run on ethereum L2's because their idea requires specific custom parameters for the whole chain."",""Sentiment farmers, yup we're back in a bull run"",""A few other things, not already mentioned is Atom's network has never gone down.

The Ethereum and Cosmos compatibility is attractive. Also, at least at face value, the staking to access prepaid debit cards and potential for making purchases is interesting.  


Are there other advantages/benefits that I should be aware of? Are there criticisms that I should be aware of before considering investing? I'm a bit surprised I haven't seen more about this project (maybe I've been willfully ignorant).","21","[""It's cool. There's alot of dApps. I got into Cosmos through $CRO.

Crypto.org network has the most compatibility with the IBC, and Cronos Network runs the EVM with multiple different DApps built on it, to interact with. Both are native CRO, just different chains running different Virtual Machines. \n\nIf you‚Äôre wanting to stake your tokens with a validator, the Crypto.org network is the network you‚Äôll use to stake, and you can LP on Osmosis by using the Crypto.org network as well. However, if you use the Cronos network, you can LP on native CRO DApps, and also utilize Minted or another NFT platform, to buy NFTs, among other DApps being built on the Cronos network. \n\nThat‚Äôs a rough rundown. Overall it‚Äôs the Crypto.com exchange token. Is a pretty decent network, but with it being tied heavily in development, to Crypto.com, if something happened to that exchange, the network probably wouldn‚Äôt have much success.

They have shady defi coins and products which are designed to trick you into long term, bounded investments, they are intransparent regarding fees, have horrible support and all their apps are deeply flawed. Moreover, they indirectly kicked all their lower tier credit card users by rendering the cards useless with radically renewed conditions. And ‚Äûlower tier‚Äú means having $3500 in CRO staked to get one of those cards.\n\nI am still sitting on about $5k CRO and will sell them all once my stack is in green.

"IBC Protocol Role in Interchain NFT","ZoltanAtom","2023-01-21 01:23:57","üí°NFTs shouldn‚Äôt be limited to the chain they‚Äôre created on or be difficult to transfer between different chains and apps. Interchain NFTs change this.  


üîé[Let's see how the #IBC¬†protocol has made NFTs multi-chain](https://twitter.com/interchain_io/status/1616469160262762497?s=20&amp;t=dhPKCwUHrZ5w8_Go_Kd80w)  


‚ñ™Ô∏èInterchain NFTs give users the freedom to choose the marketplaces, dApps, and services for their assets through a protocol for bridging chains.  


‚ñ´Ô∏èThis how it works:  Interchain NFTs use a new upgrade to the [\#IBC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBC?src=hashtag_click) protocol, ICS-721. With this universal standard, users can create, transfer and track the ownership of their [\#NFTs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFTs?src=hashtag_click) as they move from chain-to-chain.

‚ñ™Ô∏èICS-721 is compatible with existing [\#NFT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hashtag_click) standards like ERC721 and [\#CosmWasm](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CosmWasm?src=hashtag_click), ensuring that Interchain NFTs work with the tokens you already use.

‚ñ´Ô∏èAll ownership history and non-fungibility of Interchain NFTs are preserved through transfers with no additional permissioning needed. To keep things simple, NFT functions like minting and burning remain on the token‚Äôs original chain.  


&gt;What can IBC users expect?   
Multi-chain compatibility means more exposure and a larger trading base for your assets. Interchain NFTs open new opportunities for lending [\#NFTs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFTs?src=hashtag_click), posting them as collateral or exchanging for [\#DAO](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAO?src=hashtag_click) tokens.  You choose the chain, you choose the market.

‚ñ™Ô∏èWith the new [\#IBC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBC?src=hashtag_click) protocol, users are already seamlessly and securely transferring [\#NFTs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFTs?src=hashtag_click) between chains.  [Here is the first Interchain NFT transfer](https://twitter.com/irisnetwork/status/1589916516484808704?s=20&amp;t=dhPKCwUHrZ5w8_Go_Kd80w)from [@irisnetwork](https://twitter.com/irisnetwork) to [@stargazezone](https://twitter.com/StargazeZone) 

‚ñ´Ô∏èInterchain NFTs allow artists and developers to expand their user base and leverage the unique capabilities of multiple chains when building with [\#NFTs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFTs?src=hashtag_click). Compatibility between chains opens up whole new surface areas and opportunities for creators.

‚ñ™Ô∏èWith Interchain NFTs, developers can create multi-chain metaverses or game worlds through app-to-app connections. Token-gated communities can build new keys for governance and access.

‚ñ´Ô∏èInterchain NFTs grow the Interchain ecosystem by connecting more assets, people, and chains. As NFTs go multi-chain, [\#IBC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBC?src=hashtag_click) users can unlock a whole new set of worlds and opportunities.

"WYND messed up, needs your vote to launch DEX ASAP","malte_brigge","2023-01-20 06:47:19","So, WYND DEX should have launched by now, but apparently the team overlooked something crucial: the Juno blockchain's revised gas limit (as of nearly three months ago). I'll quote from the team's Medium post:

&gt; As part of the final launch sequence, we created proposal #66 to create the initial liquidity pools. Thanks to the community support and participation, this proposal passed. Our plan was to have a smooth user experience by bundling the creation of all initial pools into a single governance proposal.

&gt; However, given Juno‚Äôs decreased gas limit to 10m on 10/25/2022 https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/44, the gas required to execute proposal #66 exceeds Juno‚Äôs max gas limit and therefore cannot be executed. In order to launch the initial pools, proposal #66 needs to be broken down into 5 separate proposals to ensure each proposal adheres to Juno‚Äôs gas limit.

&gt; Typically, governance proposals on WYND DAO will take 7 days to pass. However, recognizing the community‚Äôs excitement and expectation of WYND‚Äôs imminent launch, there is an alternative solution that will allow proposals to pass much sooner. **Proposals that have 51% or more of the total voting power voting ‚ÄúYES‚Äù can be executed instantly.**

&gt; If you would like to see the DEX launch in under 7 days, then we encourage you to vote on proposal 69‚Äì73.

They also have a plan for the Wynd Foundation to help the new proposals swiftly cross the 51% threshold.

"Cosmos Check-In #9","satriapamudji","2023-01-19 11:34:59","Hey Cosmonauts, here is your 9th check-in! We're quickly approaching the end of January soon, which also means we are closer to Interchain Security coming!

If you‚Äôre new to these check-ins, the goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 10 minutes every week!

So, grab a coffee and let‚Äôs dive in.

**‚û§ Biggest news of the week**

The biggest news this week has to be the news about the hope of Terra‚Äôs ecosystem flourishing, after a class action lawsuit ‚Äî against TFL and Do Kwon alleging fraud ‚Äî has been dismissed, in addition to Terra‚Äôs recent developments.

Also, we have some updates on Interchain Security (or replicated security ‚Äî which is a term that only nerds say to be brutally honest, like me) through a forum post which expressed the need to ensure Interchain Security is sufficiently tested and secure, thus requiring an external third-party audit.

**‚û§ Tangible upgrades and launches**

This week, several updates and launches have been made in the Cosmos ecosystem.

1. Interchain Info has released a beta version of their platform, which is intended to bring together fragmented Interchain communities, educational resources, NFT collections, dApps and tools.
2. Carbon has integrated with Arbitrum, allowing users to access $wstETH, $GMX, $GNS, and $USDC natively on Carbon.
3. CUDOS, Fetch, and Desmos have all launched new projects, such as Bubbleswap, Jenesis, and Scripta, respectively.
4. Additionally, Flipside and Harbor from Comdex have made minor updates, such as deprecating certain tables from Axelar and allowing users to mint $CMST using $OSMO as collateral.

**‚û§ Non-tangible upgrades and proposals**

Next, we look at the non-tangible upgrades, which includes some exciting proposals that are either already on-chain and in the voting process, or will be up for voting in the upcoming days.

1. Composable has released an update for their Centauri testnet, which will enable the flow of assets between Picasso and Cosmos chains.
2. Band Chain has proposed BCIP-10, which will introduce a minimum gas price for network fees.
3. Injective is upgrading to v1.9, which will upgrade dependencies and allow for message signing
4. Cronos is upgrading with Galileo v1.0, which will allow for faster TPS.

‚û§ **Other interesting happenings**

* The latest edition of Alpha Navigator, a [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Institutional Report says that crypto has outperformed gold and equities straight out of the gate ‚Äî bull market?
* Bitsong is singing their songs of how this year will be a huge year for them on Cosmos, well, we will have to see about that! Meanwhile, you can check out their new roadmap.
* Artificial Intelligence has been a trending topic recently, and Odin Protocol might be one of the projects on Cosmos that will assist in the AI sector; through data availability.
* Umee markets has garnered more than $3M in TVL ‚Äî Learn more about Umee here.
* The amount of OKT for liquid staking (stOKT) has reached over 1 million, which is 1/18th of the total OKT supply! Interesting what liquid staking is doing for chains.
* The Synapse Bridge has done more than $18M in volume, and serviced over 8,000 unique addresses after their bridge to Canto went public.
* Last week, we talked about KAVA 12 mainnet, which was supposed to go live on the 19th of January. However, it was recommended that they push this back, and so, KAVA 12 will be only be live on the 25th January instead.

"üîé What are Interchain NFTs?","ZoltanAtom","2023-01-18 23:41:13","üí°[The Interchain‚Äôs NFT capabilities open up whole new opportunities for #IBC¬†developers and users.](https://twitter.com/interchain_io/status/1615717507033088000?s=20&amp;t=J5lKzTHJlZ1yotqySaYVfQ)

üëáLet's see what‚Äôs possible with Interchain NFTsüëá

‚ñ™Ô∏èInterchain NFTs were developed by Bianjie, long-term contributors to the [@Cosmos](https://twitter.com/cosmos) and [@IrisNetwork](https://twitter.com/irisnetwork) ecosystems.

‚ñ´Ô∏è[\#NFT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hashtag_click) transfers leverage the Cosmos SDK NFT module (x/nft), a native module that allows users to conduct NFT-related queries and build NFT applications.

‚ñ™Ô∏èNFT transfers leverage the Cosmos SDK NFT module (x/nft), a native module that allows users to conduct NFT-related queries and build NFT applications.

‚ñ´Ô∏èThe newly released Interchain NFT Standard (ICS-721) is an application-layer protocol allowing NFT interoperability between IBC-enabled chains. Cosmos SDK chains and [@CosmWasm](https://twitter.com/CosmWasm) chains are both supported.

‚ñ™Ô∏èICS-721 is compatible with existing standards including the ERC721 standard and has several powerful functions including ownership tracking and batch operation.

‚ñ´Ô∏èThrough ICS-721, ownership of Interchain NFTs can be preserved without reminting, and no additional permissioning is needed.

‚ñ™Ô∏èInterchain NFT interoperability gives NFT developers more freedom, while encouraging competition between chains and developers to attract users and capital to their dApps, marketplace, and services.

‚ñ´Ô∏è[\#Interchain](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Interchain?src=hashtag_click) NFTs provide more compatibility and flexibility so that [\#IBC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBC?src=hashtag_click) users can seamlessly transfer their assets from Chain A to Chain B.  [\#Interoperable](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Interoperable?src=hashtag_click) [\#NFT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hashtag_click) marketplaces unlock new opportunities for growing the Interchain ecosystem.

‚ñ™Ô∏è[\#NFT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hashtag_click) creators or developers can now experiment with cross-chain NFT collections and communities, or NFTs that update from one-chain to another.

‚ñ´Ô∏èWith Interchain NFTs, developers can build with and explore:  - Development of tools for app-to-app connections for new NFT services.  - New applications to integrate NFTs with Metaverse/GameFi areas.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe [\#IBCGang](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBCGang?src=hashtag_click) is already hyped about connecting chains to reach more users, more dApps, more new collections and more arts.  Users are already breaking ground.

&gt;[Here is the first Interchain NFT transfer](https://twitter.com/irisnetwork/status/1589916516484808704?s=20&amp;t=J5lKzTHJlZ1yotqySaYVfQ) from [@irisnetwork](https://twitter.com/irisnetwork) to [@stargazezone](https://twitter.com/StargazeZone)

‚ñ´Ô∏è[\#InterchainNFTs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/InterchainNFTs?src=hashtag_click) will expand the multi-chain experience for users while providing new opportunities for developers and networks.  Learn more about Interchain NFTs.

"Exploring the 2023 Secret Ecosystem Roadmap: A Deep Dive.","emlanis","2023-01-17 00:17:40","The crypto market faced a challenging year in 2022, with many cryptocurrencies experiencing significant losses of over 80% from their all-time highs. Despite the market downturn, a plethora of Web3 projects have been making steady progress and expanding their ecosystems. 

These projects are set to continue their growth in the upcoming year, making 2023 an exciting time for the crypto community.

As one of the Web3 projects built on the Cosmos IBC, Secret boasts an ecosystem that is constantly evolving and expanding. In 2023, its ecosystem promises to be an especially exciting year, as it is poised for significant growth and development. 

Join the deep dive into the Secret Ecosystem Roadmap for Q1 2023, and discover the potential for the project to make a big impact in the crypto world.

**The Secret Ecosystem has an ambitious plan for the first quarter of 2023**

With a total of 36 events scheduled to take place. Among these events, a major network upgrade is planned, bringing new and improved features to the Secret ecosystem. This will be an exciting time for the community as they witness the continued growth and development of the project.

These major developments include the introduction of Secret 2.0 through an on-chain proposal. The proposal aims to bring new cryptographic solutions, companion networks, and other advancements to the ecosystem. Setting the foundations for long-term adoption.

**Q1 2023 also brings a number of interesting developments in the communications and media space on the Secret ecosystem**.

The first quarter of 2023 promises to bring a host of exciting updates to the ALTER platform. 

Among these updates, the ALTER platform will be available as a native mobile app on Android, providing increased accessibility and convenience for users.

A notable feature to be introduced is NFT Gated Chats, which will allow users to access controlled chats on the ALTER platform using NFTs. 

Additionally, the Private File Manager, a feature that allows for secure and private file management within the ALTER platform, will also be introduced.

These updates demonstrate the commitment of the ALTER team to continually improve and expand the platform's capabilities, making it more user-friendly and versatile.  

The Secret Bazaar (powered by Data Vault) Testnet Launch is expected, introducing a marketplace for data where people can upload and sell various pieces of content. 

Q1 2023 also brings a number of developments in the music and privacy-preserving media space on the Secret ecosystem. 

The Eqoty main net launch is expected, to introduce a decentralized music marketplace powered by Secret NFTs. 

The Dibs Domain, a decentralized privacy-preserving domain name system, is also set to launch its test net. 

These developments showcase the continued growth and innovation within the Secret ecosystem, with a focus on Data marketplaces, communications, and Media solutions.

**Q1 2023 also brings a number of exciting developments in the NFT and gaming space on the Secret ecosystem.** 

The BIDSHOP main net launch is expected, introducing a gamified NFT auction marketplace that utilizes Secret to encrypt cross-chain bids.

Onenet and Bushi main net launches are also scheduled, Onenet is an upcoming gaming platform for Secret and beyond, while Bushi is a third-person competitive shooter video game with Secret NFT integration. 

Additionally, the ActiList test net is expected to launch, introducing a second interactive NFT marketplace on the Secret ecosystem, in addition to Stashh, which will further diversify and expand the ecosystem's offerings.

Stashh app is set up to launch, a battle arena-style game, and make further cross-chain integrations.

Additionally, the launch of the Ticketing dApp powered by Secret NFTs by V-IRL is highly anticipated, bridging the real world to the virtual world. 

Lorem Ipsum will grant public access, providing an opportunity to see how a Metaverse game integrates Secret NFTs. 

These updates showcase the continued growth and diversification of the Secret ecosystem, with a strong focus on gaming and NFTs.  

**The first quarter of 2023 brings a host of updates and new developments in the DeFi and Financial services space**

Sienna will be introducing a new decentralized user interface, designed to be accessible globally, and SiennaLaunch, a launchpad for new projects launching on IBC-enabled chains. 

On the other hand, Shade will be launching SILK, a privacy-preserving stablecoin pegged to a basket of global currencies. Additionally, ShadeSwap, a privacy-preserving, IBC-enabled stable swap and DEX, and ShadeLend, a privacy-preserving lending platform, are also expected to be launched in Q1. 

Another highly-anticipated upgrade is the SecretSwap 2.0 Mainnet Launch, which will bring a liquidity hub for the DEX, making it more sustainable and efficient.

Along with these developments, the Button Swap limit order feature is set to be introduced, allowing for more advanced trading capabilities.

YOIU Mainnet Launch, which is set to be the gateway to future IDOs of tech startups fueled by Secret tokens is expected to happen. 

Another exciting development for the ecosystem is the integration of Kado, which will enable the fiat on-ramp to be integrated with Secret dApps.

Furthermore, the FINA IDO is expected to happen, as FINA, the native token of the Fina Wallet dApp, will go live. This token will be integral to the FINA debit card offering that will allow users to spend crypto directly from their wallets!

These developments also demonstrate the continued commitment of the ecosystem to provide innovative and secure financial services for its users, with a strong focus on privacy-preserving solutions.

**Expect more developments in the tooling and security space of the Secret Ecosystem** 

PriFi Labs will be introducing its Locker and Shield features, which will enhance the security of the ecosystem. The Locker allows users to securely store their mnemonic phrases and private keys on the blockchain, while the Shield provides customizable smart contract protection for securing crypto assets. 

Additionally, the CryptoClerk Permit Viewer, a tool for creating and viewing Secret Permits, will also be rolled out. This will advance users' ability to keep track of all of their data and transactions.

The Abakhus Protocol, designed to secure health and life science data, is also set to launch its main net.

Additionally, the Serenity Shield Testnet Launch is expected to happen, along with its ICO of SERSH, the native token of the Serenity Shield dApp. Serenity Shield is a tool for backing up seed phrases and other sensitive data, which allows recovery in emergency situations. 

These developments demonstrate the commitment of the ecosystem to continuously improve and provide secure and innovative offerings for its users. 

**The first quarter of 2023 promises to be an exciting time for SCRT Labs, as it plans to introduce a range of new and innovative features**. 

Among the most highly-anticipated developments is the Walletless Experience, a framework that enables users to interact with dApps without the need for a wallet or tokens. 

Another notable feature is the IBC Randomness API, which allows apps on IBC-connected chains to generate random numbers from Secret.

 Additionally, the Private Voting framework, which allows dApps built on other blockchains to use Secret for private voting, will also be introduced. 

A Bug Bounty Program is also expected to be launched to encourage security researchers and community members to help identify and report vulnerabilities in the ecosystem. 

These new features will further enhance the ecosystem, making it more user-friendly and secure for its users. 

Secret ecosystem enthusiasts are looking forward to these exciting developments as public goods. 

**The first quarter of 2023 promises to be an exciting time for the Secret ecosystem**

With over 20 different projects actively working to drive growth and innovation within the ecosystem. From the launch of new gaming experiences, privacy-preserving solutions, and financial services, to updates and upgrades of existing dApps, the ecosystem will see a wide range of exciting developments. 

The Secret community can expect to see new features and tools to enhance the user experience and make it more accessible.

TL;DR :

Unpopular opinion: IBC and XCMP, aka XCM, are not competitors but collaborators.

What do they collab against?
Flaws in blockchain ecosystems.

Both are cross-chain communication protocols that minimize permissions and the need for trust.
Differences reside in their protocol designs.
Each makes a trade-off according to their priorities.

Technically, both IBC and XCM/P are unopinionated about the contents of the message (XCM is the message). They don‚Äôt define how those messages should be processed, similar to TCP/IP.
Why so?
- The need for future-proofing

As we design and build systems, it is important to consider not only the needs of today but also the needs of tomorrow. 
By too closely specifying protocols and optimization for current conditions, we may make it difficult or impossible to adapt to future conditions.

Consequently, seeing one as superior to another is a naive assertion.

They both aim for interoperability to overcome scalability issues by providing chains with access to each other's use cases.
There is no optimal solution, only trade-offs.","12","[""Is XCM even live at the moment? Or are they still working out the kinks?""]"

"Understanding Cosmos SDK, IBC, and ICS‚öõÔ∏è","JessicaLevi13","2023-01-15 03:20:38","While these terms are a walkover for most of the #Cosmos Maxi &amp; OGs, they could also be a handful for some #cosmonauts, especially newbies.

üîπ Cosmos SDK: This is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-Of-Stake(PoS) blockchains(like the Cosmos hub) as well as Proof-Of-Authority(PoA) blockchains.

The goal of the Cosmos SDK is to allow developers to easily create custom blockchains which can natively interoperate with other blockchains from scratch.

Features of Cosmos SDK;

-Interoperable

-PoS

-Modular

-Scalable

-Open-source

-Secure

-Sovereign, etc.


Blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK are generally referred to as application-specific blockchains.

Application-specific blockchains are blockchains customized to operate a single application.

App-specific blockchains have many benefits, some of which include;

‚úîÔ∏èFlexibility

‚úîÔ∏èPerformance

‚úîÔ∏èSecurity

‚úîÔ∏èSovereignty



üîπ ICS: Interchain Security(ICS) is the Cosmos-specific category of shared security that uses #IBC.

Cosmos blockchains are PoS chains, therefore their security is determined by the economic value of staked assets. For this reason, most new #Cosmos chains initially offer high inflationary rewards to attract validators and stakers to buy and stake. But this is not a lasting solution, sell pressure may come in over time.

This is where ICS comes in, ICS will allow #Cosmos chains to lease security to each other. This enables new or smaller chains to set up fast with access to high-level, tested security provided by the #CosmosHub.

By leveraging interchain security, a larger chain known as a ‚Äòprovider chain‚Äô can provide security to a smaller chain known as a ‚Äòconsumer chain‚Äô in exchange for some fees.

Benefits of ICS;

‚úîÔ∏èIt reduces barriers and costs of entry for consumer chains.

‚úîÔ∏èICS gives smaller chains a faster, easier, and cheaper path to the market.

‚úîÔ∏èIt could generate lots of value back to $ATOM and to the #CosmosEcosystem at large.



üîπIBC: Inter-Blockchain Communication(IBC) protocol is a standard interoperability protocol that allows two or more blockchains to trustlessly communicate with each other.

IBC is essential for applications-specific blockchains(like the ones in Cosmos Network).

A wide variety of cross-chain applications such as token transfers, atomic swaps, multichain smart contracts, and various types of data &amp; code sharding can be built using IBC.

IBC has opened up a world of interoperability in the #CosmosEcosystemüëå.","26","[""Good write up! You should post it to r/cryptocurrency, if you haven‚Äôt already"",""So when is Ics coming for us to vote&gt;?"",""Thanks so much for this info!""]"

2023 has been a good year so far for our crypto portfolios. Most tokens are up quite a bit (Source: [https://twitter.com/CosmKopernikus/status/1613864415983443971](https://twitter.com/CosmKopernikus/status/1613864415983443971)).  


But the year is only 13 days old. Therefore my question: If we look back in one year. 2023 bullish or bearish?

Look at Osmosis, only way to get it is to swap for it, not sure if [binance.com](https://binance.com) still list it.\n\nIt might slow down institutions in USA from investing but when other countries start taking advantage of the interoperability and technology, the USA will capitulate. \n\nRight now, Blackrock is joining up with coinsbase and I expect in the next bull run they are going to own Coinbase.

Even as a Canadian, I haven't seen any of their ridiculous legislation in the US spill over into the Canadian financial market yet either.\n\nI'd say at best you can feign ignorance and continue to accumulate until they take the reigns, where you might pay an SEC fine after the fact.

"Liquid staking, ICS and the fight against centralization and censorship.","Jcook_14","2023-01-12 02:59:00","The Hub is rapidly gaining a centralization problem. Of the 203 million ATOM‚Äôs bonded, Stake.fish, Dokia, Coinbase, Binance (two nodes), SG-1, and Zero Knowledge Validator, hold over 33% of the stake (rounded down, they technically hold more tokens than this). That means, based on Tendermint consensus, in order to begin censoring transactions on the blockchain, a third party just needs to buy or lawfully acquire these specific validators, and they will be able to censor the chain with, to my knowledge, no recourse by the chain itself.

***Correction: Tendermint consensus is not affected by the top 7 validators, rather, the voting power of these validators, is at 33%+. The idea that blocks will be censored, is not necessarily as large of a threat as the centralization of voting power, which is still leads to a looming threat of centralization on the Hub. We still have a lot of work to do, to remain decentralized, but with some intentional delegating, we can change the trajectory of the Hub.***

*Can we just redelegate?*

Not really, if it were that easy, people would hopefully be doing that now, instead of waiting for the network to be censored.

The second answer to this question is also, not really. Liquid staking is going to be a huge contributor to centralized stake on the Hub. Liquid staking providers have to mitigate the risk of a validator, that is holding their protocols stake, getting jailed and slashed. Therefore, they mitigate this risk with whitelisting the validators who hold their stake. ***I couldn‚Äôt find the actual validator whitelist for Stride, which I feel should be easily disclosed and should be easily obtained.*** However, I would imagine, that disclosed list would include the main validators being the ones I have listed in this post. (*LS providers should willingly disclose their whitelist, and make it easy for us as delegators to help mitigate centralization of stake by doing so. If anyone knows of this white list of validators, please share a link to it in the comments, so I can edit it into this post.*) 

This creates a massive risk, and we as a network need to mitigate this risk. One way could be through taxing all transactions that go to the Stride zone, or any other liquid staking zone, and redistributing those funds either to the treasury, to the lower bound of validators and their delegators or a mixture of these two redistribution methods. 

*Why does ICS play into this centralization risk?*

When a new sovereign chain is added into ICS, a new node is spun up, to run this chain by every validator. If these validators fail to govern these new nodes properly, they get jailed and/or slashed. Therefore, those who wish to not be jailed or slashed, must trust the validator. This risk compounds even heavier for liquid staking providers.

We as human beings, tend to trust the ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù. The optics on the Hub say that these validators that I have listed are the Validators trusted by the ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù delegators. This leads to new, uneducated delegators blindly delegating to these validators, ever increasing the stake of the validators listed above. This problem runs deep, and we have to be intentional as an educated community, to change the current path we‚Äôre on. 

*Any potential solutions?*

Yes, there are a few. Some radical and some just take intent by the community to do the right thing for the network. 

1. DELEGATE OUTSIDE OF THESE VALDIDATORS AND EVEN BETTER, OUTSIDE OF THE TOP 10. 

Sorry for yelling, but this is the easiest way to protect the Hub. Research some of the validators out of the top 10, read their tweets, medium articles, see if they interact with the community. Gain trust in them. Then, after that, redelegate to them. 

Names I trust: Golden Ratio, B-Harvest, Stakecito, Notional, Informal Systems, Citadel.one, Iqlusion, Strange-love Ventures, Forbole, Frens Validator, Smart Nodes, Polkachu, Lavender.Five.Nodes, Whisper Node, Oni, Binary Holdings, Cros-nest, Stake Systems, Chill Validation, Don Cryptonium, Bro_N_Bro, Coinhall.org, Allnodes.com, Sikka, Figment, P2P, Chorus One.

If I missed some that YOU, as a delegator trust, please comment down them down below. If you read this list and have ANY stake in a top 10 validator, please leave Reddit, take the time right now to redelegate some of your stake and then you can come back and read the remainder of the post. Please, do not read the remaining, if you have not redelegated, this is the #1 most important thing you as a delegator can do for the network. Even if it‚Äôs only 1 ATOM, get it out of the top 10. 

2. We need to constantly educate, push against misinformation and make your main crypto priority, educating on the importance of intentional delegation, private key management, liquid staking risk and other items that need addressed. People don‚Äôt understand the centralization risks in crypto. So we have to make it an emergency, every day, for the rest of eternity. If the people don‚Äôt understand proper decentralization and censorship resistance, the blockchain industry will fail and simply become a more efficient and effective arm of the current system  and internet we have today. But we don‚Äôt want that, we want freedom and Liberty on the internet, so let‚Äôs educate relentlessly. 

***If you talk crypto, you better include decentralization, it‚Äôs importance and why censorship resistance on the internet is both important **and** attainable.***

3. This is my idea I had for a censorship resistant blockchain. Its far from a complete idea, but it is important for us as a community to try and evolve the possibilities own blockchain. This idea involves a two chain, dual token model, that I hope can, at a minimum, inspire some serious discussion around censorship resistance in Cosmos and in blockchain.

*Conclusion*

I hope this helped to elaborate on the importance of intentional delegation, and the risks associated with ICS and Liquid Staking. 

I‚Äôm a massive bull on Cosmos and the IBC. I also don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm
being negative on ICS and Liquid Staking, I‚Äôm quite positive about what they will do to our ecosystem. These are amazing innovations and add great functionality to the Hub and to the ecosystem. However, there will ALWAYS be new risks, with every innovation. Blockchains, like life, are full of trade offs. So we must mitigate these trade offs anywhere possible, and I hope this post inspired you to take initiative. 

Thanks 

*EDIT: I should also add, I am an amateur in blockchain and Cosmos, although I‚Äôve spent a long time the past few years trying to understand different consensus models and their decentralization and the censorship resistance that can come from these models. I am not an expert and my information may be countered by someone with more understanding of this subject. So anyone who has a different understanding, or information, please let me know where my understanding in this post breaks down.

If the majority of nodes and users fork, they can slash or jail any colluding party. You don't need a governance vote if everybody abandons the old chain (and with POS no one is going to stay and use a centralized chain, there's really no choice but to fork). Ideally it'd be best to pass a governance vote outlining the principles of when that should happen, prior to the attack, so no one can argue that censorship is permissible. But there's no way that the whole ecosystem of developers and validators would just abandon Cosmos. There'd be a fork, and the attacker's stake would become worthless. And for that reason, it's very unlikely that someone who bought 33% of the stake would ever censor txs and make their investment useless.""]"

Apologies for not posting the 7th check-in last week on Reddit - but we‚Äôre at the 8th one now, so let‚Äôs get to it!

If you‚Äôre new to these check-ins, the goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 10 minutes every week! (Yes, we increased the read time by 3 mins because of the developments on Cosmos).

So, grab a coffee and let‚Äôs dive in.

**‚û§ Biggest news of the week**

The biggest news of this week has to be the news about stablecoins on Cosmos; and it begs the question: Are we currently facing a setback on non-US stablecoins that is just specific to Cosmos, or is this trend for the whole crypto sector?

This week, e-Money has ceased issuance of its EUR backed stablecoin (EEUR) because of the current market conditions leading to a low demand in non-US stablecoins, and the upcoming European MiCA legislation set to hinder scalability.

Rizon, on the other hand, has launched their Swiss Franc backed stablecoin, called RCHF that will be backed by fiat currency reserves from Maerki Baumann, a private bank in Swiss.

**‚û§ Tangible upgrades and launches**

Users of Osmosis have access to wMATIC after the ‚Äú$OSMO/$WMATIC 789‚Äù LP went live, and can trade MATIC and Polygon $USDC on Osmosis without having to touch a CEX.

There has also been plenty of chain updates:

1. EVMOS is now upgraded to v10.0 which introduces neat UI features for users and developers.
2. Fetch wallet is now upgraded to v0.6.2, which improves on the messaging feature.
3. Comdex is now upgraded to v7.0.0, which fixes bugs in the lend module
4. Finally, Dyson is now upgraded to v0.0.2, which updates the dependencies to the latest versions and a front-end improvement.

Last but not least, Leap Wallet has introduced ‚ÄúLeap Alerts‚Äù ‚Äî which is a notification service for Cosmos which covers updates, news, and more for 35+ chains.

**‚û§ Non-tangible upgrades and proposals**

Kava 12 will be launching on the 19th of January, with the main focus on upgrading anything related to DAO systems. Last but not least, Keplr will have a competitor: Terra Station, that is coming live during near the end of January!

‚û§ **Other interesting happenings**

1. Injective says that Solana ($SOL) is coming to Cosmos‚Ä¶ wen?
2. A $KUJI misallocation at Genesis has caused 5.3M of operational $KUJI to be locked up forever.
3. Umee markets has garnered more than $2M in TVL.
4. THORChain Savers Vaults has garnered more than $10M in TVL.
5. The Synapse Bridge has done more than $18M in volume, and serviced over 8,000 unique addresses after their bridge to Canto went public.

**Conclusion**

That marks the end of week 8, and we are soon approaching Mid January - so all the best for the month ahead! As usual, if you found this useful, I would really appreciate upvotes and please comment down below on what you think about this.

"2022 Stride Recap","CuriousCosmonaut_","2023-01-10 23:30:41","Stride shared some really exciting stuff on their 2022 recap and 2023 look forward. 

A lot of integrations have happened, are happening, or are in the voting stage: @osmosiszone, @Shade_Protocol, @IBCindex, $IST, @demexchange, @Umee_CrossChain, @Injective_, @astroport_fi, @ComdexOfficial, @EvmosOrg and I‚Äôm likely missing more!



Stride completed their 3rd security audit!


Big UX upgrades are coming to do things in 1 click instead of multiple. An example could be you have ATOM and want stakes Stride in 1 click it goes: IBC ATOM Swap to $STRD, IBC STRD, Stake STRD. Just one hypothetical example utilizing @osmosiszone.

Additional security features are being explored. While IBC is extremely resilent and battle-tested we have seen many bridge hacks. Stride is exploring implementing features like rate limiting. Helping to avoid a full drain of assets if a hack occurred.

Stride will become a consumer chain of interchain security to enhance its security further. They will likely even explore mesh security later on. Follow people like @sunnya97, @JTremback, @jelenaaa____,@Thyborg_and more if you want to continue learning about ICS/Mesh or check it out on our website by searching the terms.

Stride is having some tokenomics updates. One example is all protocol revenue will start going to stakers. Stride has already generated 20K USD worth of revenue and is on track to bring in more than 200K USD in the next 12 months.

Inflation for year 1 was actually 2.5 Million STRD instead of 9.5 Million planned reducing expected inflation.
Today Stride is gassless that may change in small ways for certain functions as they are exploring paths to minimize any network spam proactively (great choice as long as it‚Äôs small).

Liquid Governance (name TBD) coming where users can liquid stake and still vote in governance. This will be done in stages but we could even see LS into DeFi and still being able to proxy vote. Helping reduce opportunity costs further between staking and liquid staking.

Fun facts - Stride went live about 110 days ago, 5.7M is already locked, 53,660+ wallets have interacted, they‚Äôve hired 5 engineers and 4 non-engineers.

They have a Stride Council to examine validators and will make proposals they look at negative items (never voting, high fees, exchange) as well as positive things (contributions) of validator and will make a proposal. Then the community can agree to it or counter that.

Stride currently has 475K $ATOM, 1.54M $OSMO. So that's about 0.25% of staked ATOM, and 0.75% of staked OSMO.


They are planning a unique concept called a rolling airdrop. Basically instead of burning or moving unclaimed airdrops to the community pool they will keep resetting them. Basically allowing active users to keep claiming airdrops if others do not. Rewarding early adopters.

"CUDOS - Decentralized Computing Network Built on the Cosmos Ecosystem","Basir_Ahmad","2023-01-10 02:45:50","I wanted to share some information about a project called Cudos that I think the Cosmos community might find particularly interesting. Cudos is a decentralized computing network that is built on the Cosmos ecosystem and aims to make it easy for anyone to access and utilize idle computing resources. By creating a marketplace for these resources, Cudos hopes to democratize access to computing power and enable a wide range of use cases, from scientific research to machine learning.

One thing that sets Cudos apart is its focus on sustainability. The platform uses a unique proof-of-use consensus algorithm that rewards users for actively participating in the network, rather than burning energy like traditional proof-of-work systems.

"Consensus Test [Evmos Governance Post]","ctzurcanu","2023-01-09 00:58:29","# Consensus Test [Evmos Governance Post]

Discussion: the discussion is this Reddit thread

## Exposition

In a positional numeral system with an integer radix greater than 2: 1 + 1 = 2

## Meaning of the Decision

* 1. if this proposal passes: the chain affirms that 1+1=2 is true (under given conditions)
* 2. if this proposal is rejected: the chain affirms that 1+1=2 is false
* 3. if this proposal is rejected by veto: the chain wanted to punish the proposer and used any rationalization to do so. (Even at the expense of governance duties and at the cost of reducing present and future decisional legitimacy of governance.)

## Additional Note

Since this proposal is a proposition, it has to obey the rules of Propositional Calculus including that it is closed under truth-functional connectives.

As a result of this, the proposer could have made 2 proposals to achieve the same 'meaning of decision':

* prop 1 (p1):

'In a positional numeral system with integer radix greater than 2: 1 + 1 = 2'

* prop 2 (p2 that is the negation of p1: not-p1):

'In a positional numeral system with integer radix greater than 2: 1 + 1 does not equal 2'

Both with chain decision choices:

1. pass
2. reject
3. reject by veto

The table of equivalence (for any practical purposes) would be:

1. (for point 1 of the original proposal's decision meaning) if p1 passes and not-p1 is rejected
2. if not-p1 passes and p1 is rejected
3. if anything else

Therefore the proposer presented the meaning of the decision of this proposal with the intent to save voters' time and avoid proposing 2 proposals instead of 1.

## Context

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1032ehn/how\_to\_centralize\_a\_chain\_by\_manipulating\_cosmos/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1032ehn/how_to_centralize_a_chain_by_manipulating_cosmos/)

In Evmos Governance:

1. [https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83) was passed which contained a lot of text.

&gt;One of the paragraphs [there](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md#2-the-ecp-lifecycle) reads:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Phase 1: Discussion &amp; Ideation | Min. 48 hours | Forum Tag: \[IDEATION\]** The purpose of this phase is to vet ideas with the active Evmos community members. Each idea for a proposal should have its own Commonwealth thread, and discussions should be as narrowly focused as possible.

2. There is an unknown actor, not elected by the chain, who deletes or hides from the public the proposal threads from [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions), therefore nobody may be able to propose anything that is not in line with the will of that actor. Therefore the chain requirement for creating a proposal cannot be fulfilled. 

3. Presumably the same unknown actor (or a different one) banned 2 Evmos validator accounts from doing anything on [https://commonwealth.im](https://commonwealth.im): [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/main/evmos/assets/banned\_CW.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/main/evmos/assets/banned_CW.png) So the voting power represented by those 2 validators is eliminated from any future discussions. 

4. Conclusion: whoever can do this to the Evmos Commonwealth fully controls Evmos Governance.

For these reasons, for the last proposals for Evmos, we had to depart from the normal governance process.

## Governance Context

After Evmos decided:

* that the governance process [may not be in English](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/93)
* that anybody and/or nobody may [officially represent the will of the chain](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/98)
* that the chain may be allowed to [take criminal decisions](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/99)

One cannot but wonder if the chain will decide to manufacture its own facts and Mathematics.

\- the GRAV rewards would be a way to compensate the Atom holders

It would require all Hub validators running the Gravity Bridge blockchain *and* Ethereum nodes on top of already running Cosmos Hub nodes and other future consumer chains. \n\nIdeally the current validators could maintain a role as bridge operators and Cosmos Hub validators could run just Gravity blockchain instead of worrying about the bridge work. This way GRAV could remain the governance token with bridge operators also acting as governors for Gravity Bridge and Hub validators only worrying about security and keeping the chain running.

"Inflation 101","Grandpa_Joe836","2023-01-07 05:40:51","Can someone explain,  in basic terms how inflation works to help or hurt staking tokens?   So for example, evmos has an APY of 121.8% and inflation is at 52.5%.  Is this good?  Is the APY correlated to the inflation rate of token?  The higher the reward, the higher the inflation rate?   Does a lower inflation rate equate to higher returns when staking?   Does a lower inflation rate= a less volatile token? Is there a certain inflation threshold that is optimal (best to invest if inflation rate is below 50%  or something like this)?    I have lots of questions and have done some research but if someone here could break it down for me,  it would help. Thanks.

 PS great day for Evmos ‚¨ÜÔ∏è33%.....  so far","3","[""Not what you asked, but what you needed to be told is:\n\nWhen you buy a company, the best idea is to look at what are you paying and how much % ownership of the company, fully diluted, are you getting.\n\nThe problem with crypto \""investments\"" is that staking rewards and inflation may make this harder to figure out. APR/APY makes your shares of the \""company\"" increase, while inflation makes all shares in the company increase. If your shares increase 20% (staking rewards), but the overall shares increase 10% (inflation). Your ownership % of the company would change by 1.2/1.1 = 9.1% for that year. So lets assume after 1 year inflation/staking rewards ends or becomes equal to eachother. If the company is valued at 100 million fully diluted today, but your ownership rate would increase by 9.1% after 1 year, best would be to look at current mcap as 100/1.091 = 91.7 million. That is the current valuation of the company. Now, most inflation schemes are multi year, thus making the math even \""harder\"". Also there may be reductions in inflation rates and staking rewards as time passes, that also needs to be estimated in the math.\n\nSome crypto \""companies\"" have insane valuations, due to low liquid supply and not very well informed \""investors\"" just looking at staking % rewards and hype and what not, you see these future victims posting threads here and there asking questions indicating that they have no clue about valuating companies and thus would be easy prey for evil VC firms or others looking to exploit unregulated markets to take advantage of retail investors with schemes that would be illegal in the real world due to securities laws. Try not to end up like one of them, hehe ;)"",""APY is the rate to can compound your amount too in a year. And this will go down, as more people stake. If you don‚Äôt daily compound, you won‚Äôt achieve the 121%. At least that‚Äôs my understanding. \n\nInflation is just the number of tokens being created, relative to the number of tokens in circulation. \n\nThe staking APY is achieved through both inflation and fees paid from transactions."",""If you are thinking about price, you needs to understand the type of people buying the token and initial distribution of token matters more, than just inflation.\n\nEven with high inflation, the price can hold up if the supply is drip fed into the market. The price crashes when inflation fuels sellers to overwhelm buyers. There is no optimal inflation. You got to pay more attention who is buying and holding the tokens. \n\nA lot of Cosmos degen yield farmers treat high inflation tokens as a Ponzi game. They buy in-early, sell a bit initially to recover their initial capital, and then dump hard to lock in profit. When you play with these mfuckers, you can‚Äôt just stake and compound. They will bleed you dry. You got to trade and deny them profit. You can‚Äôt trust ‚Äúthieves‚Äù with profit.""]"

The context is [https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1032ehn/how\_to\_centralize\_a\_chain\_by\_manipulating\_cosmos/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1032ehn/how_to_centralize_a_chain_by_manipulating_cosmos/). This thread is intended as a public discussion space for the proposal below, brought to Evmos Governance, but hidden by those who unofficially control Evmos Commonwealth (presumably Evmos Reddit too) and, therefore, Evmos Governance.

Discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8811-retroactive-payment-for-public-goods-evmos-development-for-2022](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8811-retroactive-payment-for-public-goods-evmos-development-for-2022) (concealed, therefore this Reddit thread is the discussion)

tl;dr Same as [proposal 95](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/95), accounting for the rest of 2022.

Since [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88) has been rejected, the volunteers for Tharsis and Evmos will have the opportunity to ask the Evmos chain for clarification of the status of their efforts.

## Exposition

The for-profit developers of Tharsis were paid by salary for their development work. Then Tharsis extracted tens of millions of dollars from the apparent value of the Evmos chain to pay themselves again.

The Laurel Project which volunteered for Tharsis for developing a good portion of the Evmos chain tech and some Ethermint coding will also ask the Evmos Community if their efforts will be accepted in perpetuity as volunteering or if they will be paid as retroactive public goods funding.

## Proofs

* 1. The proof that the output of the effort exists as a public good: the videos exist and are public on YouTube, and the code exists and is public.
* 2. The proof that it is about the Evmos chain/tech: the code is used by Ethermint/Evmos.
* 3. The proof that the effort is of the quality and quantity claimed: Tharsis signed the confirmations for the effort, as comments on:
   * [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/1](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/1)

&gt;  I confirm and acknowledge the stated output. Thanks u/loredanacirstea for your hard work and dedication!

* 4. The proof that this chain accepts claims for retroactive public goods is [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88).

## Retroactive Payment

372 + 391.3 + 376 + 26 + 3.5 + 524 + 313 + 290 + 304 = 2599.8

* 2599.8h \* 255 EUR/h = 662,949 EUR
* current price: TBD EUR/ $EVMOS

Total: TBD $EVMOS

## The Meaning of the Decision

* 1. If this proposal passes: the Evmos chain pays retroactively for this public good.
* 2. If this proposal does not pass: the Evmos chain recognizes in perpetuity this public good as a volunteering effort of The Laurel Project in the interest of the Evmos Community. (or is bound to produce counter-proofs to the ones above). The presented effort was made with the intent of being offered to the Evmos Community as a volunteer effort. The legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort.
* 3. No with veto: the chain benefits from and uses this free, unpaid effort, but it has decided to punish the author of this effort, for requesting formal recognition of the volunteered effort.

With this report, we assess the performance of Cosmos and the ecosystem in 2022, based on its initial vision thanks to the data provided by Mapofzones and Coingecko. You can find the key insights below, and the link to the breakdown of the report in the comments.

Key Insights from the 2022 report

* Despite the industry experiencing significant challenges in 2022, including rising inflation rates and the depegging of TerraUSD, Cosmos has remained relatively competitive in terms of valuation, and there has not been a considerable decrease in monthly active users
* However, other application-specific blockchains on Cosmos have struggled to gain widespread adoption among users, as the majority of Cosmos‚Äô valuation comprises the Hub
* Cosmos has made progress in terms of the ease of creating new application-specific blockchains, and Interchain modules coming out in 2023 will make it much easier
* In conclusion, we believe that 2023 will be a turning point for Cosmos, with the predicted development of over 100 interconnected zones and the majority of valuation spread across various application-specific blockchains by year-end of 2023

Hope you guys enjoy the report and the dive into specific metrics of the Cosmos ecosystem as much as I did, and as usual, if you found this useful, I would really appreciate if you could:

"Why $SILK is the Future of Stablecoins: A Closer Look at Shade Protocol's Solution","InvierteWeb3","2022-12-31 16:14:43","Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of an asset, such as the US dollar, and offer a more stable store of value compared to other volatile cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market by providing a way for users to hold value and transfer funds without volatility. They also serve as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto, and are commonly used on DeFi platforms. 

&amp;#x200B;

$SILK is a stablecoin that is issued by Shade Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. According to the information available on the Shade Protocol website, SILK is designed to be a stable, transparent, and secure alternative to traditional fiat currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the key features of $SILK is that it is backed by a basket of assets, rather than a single asset like many other stablecoins. This basket is called the SILK Reserve, and it is intended to provide stability for the SILK stablecoin. The $SILK Reserve is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called the SILK DAO, which is responsible for ensuring that the value of $SILK remains stable.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to maintain the stability of $SILK, the SILK DAO uses a dynamic peg mechanism. This mechanism allows the SILK DAO to adjust the supply of $SILK in response to changes in demand, which helps to maintain the value of $SILK at a stable level. The SILK DAO can also use a variety of strategies, such as buying and selling assets in the SILK Reserve, in order to manage the value of $SILK.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to its stability, $SILK is also designed to be transparent and secure. The SILK DAO publishes regular reports on the state of the $SILK Reserve, and the entire process of managing the $SILK stablecoin is transparent and open to scrutiny. The $SILK stablecoin is also secured by smart contracts, which help to ensure that it is safe and secure.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, $SILK is a stablecoin that is designed to offer a stable, transparent, and secure alternative to traditional fiat currencies. It is issued by Shade Protocol and backed by a basket of assets known as the SILK Reserve, which is managed by the SILK DAO. The SILK DAO uses a dynamic peg mechanism to maintain the stability of SILK, and the entire process of managing the stablecoin is transparent and secure.","15","[""I remember when shade and silk were just going to be a copy of Luna and terra/USD on secret"",""Dynamic stablecoin.\n\n\n\nNOPE."",""‚ÄúFuture of stablecoins‚Äù - here we go again, lol.

The fact that a viewing key can be used at the user's discretion for audit compliance will help on the regulatory side. But other than that there is no reason that any merchant should have access to the entirety of your purchase history just because you transact with them \n\nFor people that worry about the 'basket of assets' side of things, I would argue that is mostly an issue of misunderstanding. It's composed of various stablecoins plus gold and Bitcoin. The idea is to create peg not tied to a singular currency in part as an inflation hedge. A lot of really interesting discussions around that take place on the forum and Discord, which I'd recommend (Here is a good start wrt recent developments https://forum.shadeprotocol.io/t/silk-peg-composition/272)\n\nAll in all, I'm very bullish on this project long term"",""‚ÄúBacked by a basket of assetts ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú \n\nIn other words.

"Continuing the Thought experiment of Governance in Blockchain. Dual Chain and Token Governance Model (Rough concept, Rough draft)","Jcook_14","2022-12-30 13:42:29","Warning: Sorry for the very long post, but this is an interesting idea I wanted to get out there.

***Dual Chain and Token Governance Model:***

*Goal: Structuring a Decentralized governance structure, that can act as the sovereign governance execution and data availability layer. Built specifically to interact with a Cosmwasm smart contracting platform and perform the necessary Governance actions, as the arm of execution across the IBC.*

**Necessary utilities needed to make such a structure possible:**

* Interchain Accounts
* Interchain Queries
* ZK proofs capability over IBC
* Exclusive or permissioned version of ICS, securing the governance chain, using the smart contracting chain

**Introduction**

Proof of stake blockchains to date, have a glaring issue that shouldn't be overlooked. They do not have the level of decentralization needed to sufficiently create a censorship resistant entity. Most proof of stake chains do not have the appropriate number of validators to protect the chain against real, large scale third party threats, and the chains that claim to, tend to have tons of validators being run by a few entities. Blockchains in reality, have two primary ideas around Governance, you have the school of thought, found mostly in proof of work chains like Bitcoin, which has a massive number of nodes validating transactions, with a nearly immutable code unless there is total consensus among the miners themselves. The next school of thought, tends to be more applicable in Proof of Stake. In this model, the network tends to operate in a democratic manner where the delegators stake to the active validators of their choice, and then gain the opportunity to vote on-chain, to decide where the network should go next. This includes things such as where funds from a network treasury should go, whether a network upgrade should be uploaded, and many other democratic decisions to be made.

However, there is one fact that tends to be overlooked by many in the crypto space. If a validator set, or a majority of the validator set were to be corrupted in some way, delegators have almost no recourse towards the validators to hold them accountable, outside of selling their tokens and finding a new chain that aligns with their values. This is an inherent risk in the validator/delegator relationship, your values only matter, if the validator gives you the power to matter. However, the harsh reality is, validators are the sole controllers and gatekeepers, of the most important part of a blockchain, the code. This makes it important in my opinion, to figure out how we can get some level of recourse built in at the code level, for delegators to check the power that the validators currently hold.

In this post, I will introduce a Governance system, built on the Cosmos IBC, that, with certain functionality, could level the field of power in the delegator/validator relationship. I bring up certain topics like the ability for delegators to slash or jail a validator directly if a supermajority believe it is a necesssary move. I also bring up concepts like high deposits for proposals, with deposit incentives and slashing, depending on how the vote goes on-chain. I want to say, I am by no means a ""blockchain expert"", not even close, just someone who has fun thinking about blockchain governance and decentralization. So feel free to critique and comment on the concepts and ideas I am bringing here and let me know where I may be off or where I should look deeper into, to gain better perspective of how governance on the blockchain could work. This post in it's entirety is regarding a specific app-chain I have conceptualized, however bits and pieces of this idea could be interesting on other chains, in their governance systems as well.

**Details of the two chain Governance System**

This model will consist of a general, cosmwasm smart contracting chain, with a seperate side chain that strictly runs as the sovereign Governance execution layer. Items such as the delegators execution module will require a significant amount of predetermined functionality that will be necessary for such automated Governance to occur. So rather than create significant code complexity and attempt to run both a smart contracting platform and automated Governance modules on one chain, and sacrifice the scalability of one chain. I have opted to implement a second chain, that can handle the code complexity, incentivizes the additional load for validators using its own token and will give a permissionless governance structure allowing for delegators to have certain rights deemed necessary in a decentralized and secure blockchain. These rights will be automatically executable, rather than relying on a developer plan and validator execution. These rights are built into the system, to be enacted by the will of the delegators at any time where consensus of such action would be deemed necessary.

The two chain model would offload the vast majority of the complexity out to a second chain that‚Äôs dedicated to the data availability and execution of governance and the many different forms it can take. This allows for the main smart contracting chain to do what its best at, which is executing contracts and acting as the overall consensus layer necessary to ensure safe, secure transactions with interoperability. This operates on the surface as the domain of validator power. They execute the transactions in a permissionless way, acting as the will of developers, smart contracts and the customers these contracts are designed to be utilized by. The second chain has a very specific skill set as a Governance module, the predetermined slashing functions and delegator voting transactions will happen on this chain, away from the general influence of the smart contracting chain and allowing Governance transaction and contracting transactions to be separate, but remain linked together with interwoven functionality between the chains.

This Governance chain will need the ability to perform these slashing functions at the will of the delegators, and therefore the IBC will need to have such functionality, that one chain can execute its will on the other chain in a permissionless manner. I do believe that functionality is possible with new functions like Interchain Accounts and Interchain Queries, however a variation of Zero Knowledge proofs across IBC may be necessary as well, to be able to provide a proof to the contracting chain, acting as the command to slash as specific validator when the proof is received. Without ZK proofs, this information could provide issues of overwhelmingly bloated IBC transactions and may not allow the direct assurance needed to make the transaction fully automatic. In a situation without ZK proofs, this may require developer and validator action and trust, in order to execute the necessary actions. With that said, the two main functions that will be necessary are the zero knowledge proof, vindicating that action is necessary, and the predetermined functionality of automated slashing on the smart contracting chain, to ensure proper execution.

ZK proofs and the automated governance module, that would act as the execution ‚Äúcontract‚Äù and provides proof of mutual assent between the governance and smart contracting chain. Resulting in a trustless and permissionless piece of core functionality in the relationship between these two chains. An example of permitted action from a ZK proof from the Governance chain, would be it sending an IBC proof that, in the governance module would read like this;

‚ÄúA slashing action was voted on and approved, by a supermajority of delegators, for the slashing of (X) validator for (Y) reason stated in our mutual assent, here is the (ZK) proof. Therefore per the terms of our agreement, you need to slash (X) validator for breaching their social contract with delegates‚Äù

This should act as seamless, automatic action with no need to trust developers to create such code and no need to trust validators to upgrade or execute such code. Rather the code is a part of the basic function of both of these chains, with terms of mutual assent stored in both chains, in a hard coded module, allowing it to be performed as any action on the chain would be and with equal immutability.

**Securing the system, shared security between the two chains**

The governance chain will operate under a similar structure to a permissioned version of ICS. This will allow them to have the same level of security, with a smaller amount of governance rewards being paid to delegators, since the majority of tokens should be earned through governance participation.

I believe this model will allow for a high degree of value capture between the chains and will be the best option to keep the validator set the same for both chains by utilizing ICS for a model with two chains needing to be attached at the hip, so to speak.

Whether the chain will have the capability to onboard other chains similar to how the Cosmos Hub does, would be left to the market to decide and would leave additional opportunity for growing its interchain services.

**How a proposal may work on the two chain Governance structure** (rough rundown)

* A proposer starts by connecting their wallet to the central governance chain and governance hubs UI. Ideally this wallet would be whatever the most popular wallets are in the Cosmos ecosystem (Keplr, Cosmostation).
* The proposer initiates the UI to make a proposal. They will provide a full detailed run down of their proposal, and this proposal will initiate into the deposit stage.
* The deposit in general, will be a rolling .5% of the circulating supply, that adjusts per day, at an epoch of its own. This deposit amount will not change for the 21 day deposit period. After 21 days, if the proposal has not had the required amount deposited, then the deposit will be disbursed back to the original wallets that sent the funds.

(Note: Should a deposit be editable while in the proposal phase? Maybe a certain time like 19 out of the 21 day deposit period, so negotiation and debate can take place with meaningful results can be added to the proposal. What stops this from frequently changing so people can‚Äôt keep up, fee per edit?)

* A successful deposit will be automatically, in its final form, be uploaded on chain for official voting.

Deposit risk and incentive- The goal of this model is to incentivize and encourage good governance with on-chain, economic assurances. One assurance would be, depositors will be incentivized for on-chain proposals that pass through the voting process. However, economic assurances must come with balance. The balancing power is, if a proposal ends its voting period with a ‚ÄúNo With Veto‚Äù, then a deposit slash (example, 10% of total deposit slashed) will occur, giving a penalty for wasted on-chain governance,

as voted on by the voters. This risk/reward structure should motivate good proposals, with wording that comes easy enough for people to understand as well as ideas that are sound. While spam proposals will likely never make it on-chain, as most spam stops at the hub deposit period. The overarching idea being that depositors are more likely to want to preserve capital and only risk there tokens on a proposal they see as valuable, to earn incentives, rather than risking a slashed proposal.

* It is from the point of the proposal being uploaded that a 10 day voting time frame will begin, with a 40% quorum minimum at the time of the end of the period. After this period and depending on results, the deposits plus or minus the incentive/penalty will be automatically returned. Deposits that are slashed can be sent to a treasury, sent to delegators of the staking token, burnt or wherever the community may decide in this matter.

**How software upgrades could be handled on-chain:**

Software upgrades inherently come with many responsibilities to try to work out every potential issue before submitting a proposal for the validators to upload. A testnet requirement with hub functionality that allows for multi-validator slashing by delegators, if they do not utilize the full testnet and do proper due diligence. This system would need to have some level of oracle functionality to relay information of the start of a testnet, and the time the testnet has been in process. The due process of the Testnet would be that the full testing period should be fulfilled before the Testnet ends and the upgrade is uploaded. This requirement can be sufficiently nullified if a signaling proposal is made by the community and passes, to allow early exit of the Testnet, penalty free.

**Slashing and Jailing process**

The slashing punishment, is a power left ultimately to the judgment of the delegators to enact, as this power would be strictly left to a delegator only model with no voting ability by any validators. A way to accomplish this could be through the knowledge of the validators address used for staking reward payouts and general voting address, and using that knowledge to having those addresses added as invalid addresses for the delegator specific voting module. Delegators will have this exclusive slashing ability, however, this should have an element of due process of on-chain approvals, to minimize the risk of delegator abuse.

* This process needs to start with a general signaling proposal, however this signaling proposal should take place in a delegators specific voting module, where validator wallets will be excluded from voting, to allow for a proper democratic voting demonstration.
* This general signaling proposal will require a 51% quorum with a 67% approval before this would be considered passed and moving into the execution phase.
* The execution phase will add in what would be new functionality of automated slashing, where the delegators can pick out which validators are to be slashed, and this slashing will be done at the protocol level, via an execution proposal, that will include a specific set of ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù behind why delegators are proposing to implement a slash, with an additional secondary vote to ensure the slashing execution is the way the network wants to proceed. The proposal period will be the same as the signaling proposal at 51% quorum and 67% approval of this slashing. The Execution module will require a significant amount of predetermined functionality that will be necessary for such automated Governance to occur.

*Jailing a validator*

* An additional delegator power that could be added to a Governance system could be a delegation jailing a validator from the network of the jailing is deemed necessary by delegators and the function deemed necessary to be jailed, is not automated on-chain. This could be a process very similar to the slashing function and could prorate in a similar model.

**General actions that could constitute a reason for delegators right to slash or jail a validator:**

* A validator or multiple vote on a proposal in a way that is out of character for the general social consensus of the network, thereby giving the network recourse against actors who seek to change the network outside the scope of what is generally seen as reasonable by the network. This recourse could cause a validator or multiple to seek a hardfork, which could split the network, but the network should seek a hardfork if enough validators and many delegates agree. Ultimately the right to fork should persist, and these governance measures are to be enacted when it is deemed most necessary to keep the general social consensus heading on the track that is generally approved.
* If a validator or multiple validators were to become corrupted in some way by a malicious third party. It may be possible, in this scenario, for a significant slash or jailing could occur, that could effectively remove or limit the corrupted validators power over the network. Restaking to a safe, trusted and not corrupted validator would also be a possibility, however in some cases where a wealthy validator is holding most of its delegation by itself, this slashing could do material harm to the overall power the validator had.

Certain parameters would need to be set to make these Governance proposals executable, which could take some amount of foresight. However, the checks and balances of this system could be extremely interesting.

**A deeper look at risks and rewards in depositing for a proposal:**

The role of incentives is a straightforward idea, however the model I prefer is somewhat unique, at least compared to what I‚Äôve seen. In most incentive structures the incentive is used to pay someone for voting or pay someone to vet proposals. However I don‚Äôt believe paying someone to vote, actually generates a good governance system, rather one where small amounts are paid to those who vote and a larger amount to the privileged ones with the time to review and vet proposals, or become a member of some council. I think there is a better and more inclusive way to incentivize good governance.

Essentially, the process comes with the premise that if we want to ensure good, high quality governance, the proposal needs to be backed by a deposit that depositors are risking, in hopes that the proposal is quality enough for the community to approve, thereby giving the depositors a reward paid out in the Governance token. This reward, however, would only be paid out after the proposal has passed, then the depositers into then successful proposal will receive their incentives for promoting good governance on the blockchain.

The flip side of the coin is that if a proposal ends with a ‚ÄúNo With Veto‚Äù, then it was likely a wasted proposal and should be slashed, as a punishment for wasting time and blockspace. This skin in the game approach, would make the proposers think twice about small little proposals that don‚Äôt really propose a meaningful addition to the network. This slashing risk however, is only limited to a ‚ÄúNo With Veto‚Äù. We do not want to take this too far with making a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù voted proposal be slashed. Many ‚ÄúNo‚Äù voted proposals will have legitimate changes offered, that the network simply didn‚Äôt want to utilize at the time or they simply felt that the proposal did not represent the will of the delegators. So these ‚ÄúNo‚Äù votes will not be slashed, rather the full deposit will be returned after the voting period has ended.

**A recent example of bad governance in Cosmos**

Many community members didn‚Äôt like Prop 89, one of the Cosmos Hubs most recent governance proposals. However, with all of the controversy and ruckus it brought amongst the community, the proposal passed thanks to a few powerful validators.

This proposal could have had a very different outcome, had it been in the two chain governance system. In my opinion, the proposal likely would have never met the deposit amount of .5% of the current circulating supply without the entity proposing it making a large deposit or some larger entities coming in and helping to make the deposit of roughly 1,460,000 ATOMs. Would the ATOMs they had requested even been worth the risk of losing a large sum of ATOMs if the proposal was a ‚ÄúNo With Veto‚Äù and the deposit was slashed?

These different risk/reward additions to governance could encourage good governance in a very meaningful way. You could see that the valuable proposals and upgrades are the ones that make it through the pipeline, and the governance that doesn‚Äôt make an impact will never make it through the deposit period without a significant risk to the deposited funds.

**Shorter validator voting period**

In general, a separate issue could be addressed. The fact that validators were able to vote last minute to make prop 89 pass, is a flaw that gives the largest and most powerful, the ability to totally sway a proposal. So the two chain model would also include a 2 day difference between the validator voting period and the delegator voting period. Within this two days, the delegators would have the ability to win over public opinion who may not have voted or may have abstained, thereby allowing the delegators to have a bit of time for coordination in the event that a proposal is on the brink of passing or failing, and the community at large wants to sway it in their preferred direction.

**Conclusion**

What benefit could this experiment of a two chain governance structure provide to the community and blockchain as a whole. Largely, this model would be a proof of concept. That this model could work to help decentralize a network and level the playing field for its delegators, rather than just its validators, and potentially make it more secure against third party risk.

The idea that a blockchain is as decentralized as its stake among validators, is a flawed narrative. Validators have a sole oligarchy over the entrance if effective code, and one coordinated effort by a majority of the validators, could seriously affect the network in a negative way. The slashing and jailing at the code level, with the rights to do so at the delegators full discretion, could be an interesting way to solve the issue of third party risk, and gives the delegators recourse to fight back against a corrupted or malicious validator set.

Please feel free to comment and critique (Also, sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes). This is an important topic going forward in blockchain, as we need to figure out how to become more decentralized and censorship resistant as time goes on. I am loving this thought experiment. Feel free to read my last post as well, regarding the same topic as it will give further explanation as to where I have come from throughout this thought experiment. It is linked down below.

Thanks for reading.","10","[""Thanks for taking the time to draft this thoughtful post. It's definitely got some interesting ideas to work with. I'll just add some of my thoughts as I saved them in note form:\n\n&gt; This model will consist of a general, cosmwasm smart contracting chain, with a seperate side chain that strictly runs as the sovereign Governance execution layer.\n\nIs the secondary chain really neccessary? Is the idea that the general CosmWasm chain would be like a Juno/Neutron type platform and the governance chain like an off-Hub DAO DAO?\n\n&gt;This Governance chain will need the ability to perform these slashing functions at the will of the delegators, and therefore the IBC will need to have such functionality, that one chain can execute its will on the other chain in a permissionless manner.\n\nThis is addressed by your follow up point:\n&gt; The governance chain will operate under a similar structure to a permissioned version of ICS.\n\nCombined the permissioned ICS with ICA and ICQ \n\n&gt; Zero Knowledge proofs across IBC may be necessary as well\n\nAFAIK there is no zk-IBC implementation yet. There are teams researching it but this could be a hold up in the concept here.\n\n&gt; ‚ÄúA slashing action was voted on and approved, by a supermajority of delegators, for the slashing of (X) validator for (Y) reason stated in our mutual assent, here is the (ZK) proof. Therefore per the terms of our agreement, you need to slash (X) validator for breaching their social contract with delegates‚Äù\n\nRather than punishing validators for gov participation why not simply remove the role of governor from the operators? If validators know they may be slashed they may be less likely to be willing to participate in the chain. Some validators may opt to participate in governance as well as the role of node operator. Not all would though. \n\n\n&gt; The deposit in general, will be a rolling .5% of the circulating supply, that adjusts per day, at an epoch of its own.\n\nA rolling deposit seems like an unneccessary complexity. While interesting I just don't really see much point myself. Perhaps a periodic increase but even then I think gov adjusted deposit is manageable enough, especially considering the role of the hub chain in this sense is governance why not keep this open to being governed?\n\n&gt; A proposer starts by connecting their wallet to the central governance chain and governance hubs UI.\n\nICA would come in handy at this stage. Interchain Accounts would allows a user to interact with both chains easily. \n\n&gt; A testnet requirement with hub functionality that allows for multi-validator slashing by delegators, if they do not utilize the full testnet and do proper due diligence.\n\nAgain, if I am a node operator and I see this risk I would really second guess if I want to participate. Better to just separate node operations from governance. Maybe could take a different approach with Technical Governance (Upgrades, code changes etc.) and Social Governance (Fund allocations, signal props, change suggestions). I haven't thought this out well enough to elaborate. \n\n&gt; The slashing punishment, is a power left ultimately to the judgment of the delegators to enact, as this power would be strictly left to a delegator only model with no voting ability by any validators.\n\nThis could be abused and if a validator has no say then they have a lot of risk with little incentive to participate. \n\n&gt; A validator or multiple vote on a proposal in a way that is out of character for the general social consensus of the network, thereby giving the network recourse against actors who seek to change the network outside the scope of what is generally seen as reasonable by the network.\n\nThis is where the power above can be abused. Why are they punished for having an opinion that's different from the rest? You mention hard forks but if validators think one thing and delegators another, in the event of a hard fork who would run the delegator fork if they slashed all of the validators out? \n\nI don't know how I feel about social slashing. Generally I am against it because social layers are highly subjective.\n\n&gt; However I don‚Äôt believe paying someone to vote, actually generates a good governance system\n\nStrongly agree with this. Voting incentives is a good way to lead to passive arbitrary votes for the sake of the rewards. I think a system punishing malicious actors (such as NoWithVeto) is a better approach than rewarding participation in general.""]"

The goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 7 minutes every week! So, grab a coffee and let‚Äôs dive in.

**‚û§ 2022 in recap for Cosmos**

The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant challenges in 2022, including rising inflation rates, the depegging of TerraUSD which hurt Cosmos, and finally the collapse of FTX and various centralized entities. Despite these doom events, Cosmos has remained relatively competitive in terms of valuation, and there has not been a huge decrease in monthly active users.

However, other application-specific blockchain on Cosmos has struggled to gain widespread adoption among users, as the majority of Cosmos‚Äô valuation comprises the Hub.

In our report, we made an argument that we believe 2023 will be a turning point for Cosmos, with the predicted development of over 100 interconnected zones and the majority of valuation spread across various application-specific blockchains by year end of 2023 ‚Äî with supporting data.

Look forward to the full release of this report, as we will release it in the next few days. Most importantly, let us know what you think about the report.

**‚û§ Tangible upgrades and launches**

Next, we look at some of the tangible updates and launches that we have seen this week, and can interact with in the next coming days (or now even depending on when you read this).

First up, we have new strategies from Sommelier that will be live on the 29th of November at 4pm UTC. These strategies, ‚ÄúSteadyUNI and SteadyMATIC‚Äù are part of the steady strategies.

We are also blessed with the new releases of networks like Lava Network, which allows developers to trustlessly access Cosmos Hub data with Lava‚Äôs SDK, and a new network called Nibiru that is now on phase 2 of their testnet, which introduces faster finality, Nibi-Swap pools (AMM pools), and supports permissionless deployment of CosmWasm smart contracts.

Next, Injective‚Äôs explorer has been upgraded, allowing for address details to include CW20 token balances and adds CW20 smart contract balance support.

Kava is also now integrated with Axelar, and satellite money users can now transfer assets from any connected chains to Kava.

**‚û§ Non-tangible upgrades and proposals**

Last but not least, we take a look at the non-tangible upgrades, and interesting proposals.

Just this week, Syntropy has announced that they have switched to the Cosmos ecosystem to fulfill their vision of innovating the future of the Internet by building solutions that improves the decentralization, security and performance of the Internet with DARP and OBX.

Following that, Kujira has announced this week that Sonar will be the name of their wallet, with a focus on native mobile experience that is crafted for a seamless DeFi experience.

We will also soon have 2 interesting proposals, one of which is the second security upgrade for Gravity Bridge which introduces invariant checks, and adds fees, and the proposal for Sentinel Hub‚Äôs upgrade to v0.10.0, which is a critical upgrade as it primarily allows for the functioning of smart contracts and enables the token revenue sharing system.

‚û§ **Other interesting happenings**

1. Ignite is currently negotiating terms to become an independent entity from All in Bits (AiB).
2. Sei has recently partnered with Babylon to enchance the security of Sei by leveraging Bitcoin‚Äôs security. Sei has also partnered with SYNTHR to allow users exchange value seamlessly without the need for bridges.
3. ZetaChain has posted their wrap up of 2022, which goes through the metrics and achievements that they have achieved this year, such as having more than 740k users on the Testnet.
4. If you are looking for the hottest news about NFTs, AssetMantle has recently posted a thread which covers the latest news in the NFT space.

"Some ideas for governance going forward","Novel_Violinist_410","2022-12-25 11:30:15","In light of proposal 89 passing unexpectedly, I thought we could discuss some governance changes. Here are some ideas:


- A waiting period after a proposal passes to allow for a second referendum. If this second vote reaches perhaps a higher threshold then the proposal does not pass. This would be useful for proposals which ask for significant funds from the community. 

Many delegators were likely blindsided by the outcome of prop89 because they may not  have the same ability to consistently track proposals, and only knew about this when it broke news.

this means that when validators vote on behalf of delegators, delegators have a chance to review the decisions made by their validators and nullify them should those validators turn out to not represent the delegator‚Äôs values.

- certain types of proposals, such as ones which require huge community funding, require a threshold of delegator voter.

- heres an interesting one: the subsequent approved funding for a proposal is supplied proportionally by validator and delegator funds, the community chest will effectively be partitioned into two chests. If a proposal passes asking for 10k, and 60% of yes votes were validators, then 60% of the funding will come from validators and 40% from delegators.","13","[""The best way to stop this from happening again is for people to redelegate out of the top 10 and spread that redelegation among various smaller validators. The top 10 hold like 70 million ATOM tokens, that‚Äôs like a fourth of the circulating supply. The best and easiest answer to this is people redelegate or spread their stake out. Plus people who are speculating and gaining some yield, need to take their tokens off of Coinbase and Binance and stake them correctly. That means two exchanges hold like 20 million ATOM, that‚Äôs like 8% of the circulating supply and way more of the voting power‚Ä¶ come on people, there are harder issues to solve. \n\nWhat we really need is a way to successfully incentivize good Governance. The blockchain may allow for good and moral incentivizing of Governance, which I believe is a resource that is way underutilized. I mean we incentivize Validators, but we don‚Äôt have any incentive structure for the governance of voting. Personally I believe we need a new Governance token that could act as an incentive token for people who deposit into successful governance proposals.

Sure he could just change the ""brand"" name and do it again as he's doing now, but at least i believe he'd be able to post it 2-3 times and then the utility of that account would be already over, and the practice would become time consuming also for the author of these scams.

Archway Protocol  is an incentivized smart contract platform that rewards developers for their contributions in the ecosystem.

Archway can be seen as a launchpad to Cosmos. Archway provides developers with the means to fundamentally alter the value propositions for dapps by enabling them to build on numerous chains throughout the ecosystem, while still benefiting from Archway‚Äôs smart rewards system.

Wondering how this reward system works?

By including network-level rewards directly into the protocol, Archway makes sure that dapp creators get their fair share of benefits and incentives. Dapps earn a portion of transaction fees and inflationary rewards in exchange for their contributions to the network, similar to how validators are rewarded in a typical PoS chain.

Through the use of this shared income model, dapps can have access to regular rewards, a genuine interest in the protocol that underpins them, and an opportunity to benefit from the success of the community.","13","[""mods pls get rid of obvious paid shilling""]"

The game takes place in deep space where you can mine and trade commodities, buying and upgrading ships, developing planets, build up alliances with other players and conquer those who don't align with your targets, the possibilities are endless and I love every single one.

The game reminds me a lot to EVE Online and I really love that game, the addition of blockchain properties definitely brings a boost to the gaming experience since you will have true ownership of your assets besides the trustlessness factor.

Nerd games usually involve a lot of rules, perks and details to their whole gameplay schematics and all this can be found on the [Whitepaper 2.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AWfror6UuM1ijG3qEuVg8-F0AdJS63H-/view) which honestly has some amazing information that cannot be missed. Among the details which really excited me was the involvement with [Regen Network](https://twitter.com/regen_network), a Cosmos-Native blockchain focused on ecocredits issuing and environment sustainability, one of the most tangible real-world solutions made possible thanks to the blockchain, great job lads.

Can't deny I'm really bullish on the project although it may take some time to publish a full version since as most might know a top tier level game development takes a lot of work but I'm glad to be around soon and grab myself a seat. Those who are around at these early stages will go far ahead on the galaxy.

"Maya Protocol - The project overview","CryptoWildBtc","2022-12-22 02:28:00","Hello! That's my second post about Maya Protocol. The first one was written by AI and that wasn't a good idea. Here I'd like to focus on the general overview. What the Maya protocol is? Wen launch? 3 TOKENS? Why that much? And the other purposes. I hope after this short article You'll be familiar with Maya! Let's go &lt;3

The main idea is cross-chain native swaps without bridged/wrapped assets. As the Cosmos Network community You're probably in a good relationship with the Thorchain Protocol. That's great cause the Maya Protocol is a friendly fork of it. What does it mean? Thorchain looks favorable at Maya's Team work and they aren't a competition in any case. 

So why need another one? That's straight. Maya is going to relieve Thorchain in case of the huge amount of transactions. With the new protocol, there is easier to implement new ideas/solutions cause it's harder to operate on a live organism which Thorchain is. If another project runs successfully with similar technology it may increase the community trust in general. Like, today Thorchain is a single dancer. Maybe Maya could help spread the word about cross-chain NATIVE swaps. 

Okay. Now quick introduction to infrastructure. Validators operate all transactions in a decentralized way thanks to TSS (Threshold Signature System) and Tendermint. Who knows that for Thorchain? It keeps the private keys to the vaults in a distracting way. Any bad behavior = bond slashed. That's the well-battle-tested mechanism. We don't need to go deeply today. 

One of the main differences between protocols is the way how liquidity assets are working. In Maya, each pool is combined with $CACAO (main protocol token) but in the 1:1 proportion and there are lying in the same place. Security and liquidity nodes are the same ""place"". In theory, it should ensure better capital efficiency and simultaneously keep security on the same level. 

What about $CACAO? This is the utility token. Each pool in the protocol is connected with it. The total supply setting up at 100.000.000. Token has a ""free launch"" action. It means you're locking your coins for 21 days and after this period You'll get the $CACAO in the 1:1. Let's imagine. I decided to lock my BTC for this action. After this period I'll get my BTC back plus $CACAO with the same value as my locked coins. Why? Because each pool in the protocol is bonded with $CACAO 1:1. 

100% of the $cacao token will be distributed that way. No other way to get this token before. 0% team, 0% VC, 0% presale. The protocol will have also other coins ($MAYA and $AZTEC) but if you're interested I believe You're going to check the information about it by Yourself. The one thing that is valuable to mention now is that the price of these two coins doesn't disturb the work of the protocol. 

If you worry about the security aspect of that free launch action you should sleep well. We're waiting for the security audit to be an announcement before it. Moreover, if You'll be still interested in $CACAO you will be able to buy it just from the market. (It is just a fact. It's not any financial advice.) 

Anyway. I hope it's clear to you what Maya protocol is.

"Cosmos: Check-in #5","satriapamudji","2022-12-21 22:05:52","Hey Cosmonauts, here is your fifth check-in! Christmas is coming soon, so before anything else, I just want to wish everyone happy holidays and let‚Äôs run it back in 2023 (I hope).

Once again, the goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 7 minutes every week! So, grab a coffee and let‚Äôs dive in.

**‚û§ Tangible upgrades and launches**

This week, we start off with some of the tangible updates and launches that we have seen this week, and can interact with in the next coming days (or now even depending on when you read this).

First up, we have Secret Network‚Äôs Shockwave Omega going live, which introduces a higher TPS and lower gas fee because of their change in engine from wasmi to wasm. Alongside that, Quicksilver has also been successfully launched this week, and for users, this means that airdrops for the $QCK token and liquid staking on Quicksilver will come soon.

Last but not least, Stargaze Names will mint on the 23/24th of December for the public, and having a Stargaze name will allow you to have names for all IBC-connected zones.

**Extra:** This week, a little birdy told us that a new telegram bot, called ‚ÄúCosmos Governance Briefings‚Äù is live. The bot is able to notify you on Cosmos proposals, and has other neat features like being able to summarize these proposals for you, thanks to GPT-3, and an embedded fraud detection for proposals! Try it and let us know what you think about it.

**‚û§ Non-tangible upgrades and proposals**

On the other side of things are non-tangible upgrades, like upgraded developer experiences and interesting proposals that will change the direction of the Cosmos ecosystem.

The gift for developers keep on coming, as Wasmd is upgraded to v0.30, which implements a lot of the community feature requests, such as integrating the Authz module, upgrading the IBC protocol to v4.2.0 with Interchain Accounts v0.2.4, bumping the Go minimum to 1.19 and much more.

Next up, WhiteWhale is bringing an Interchain liquidity infrastructure, which includes flash loans and arbitrage, to Comdex with 8 proposals.

Last but not least, Sommelier will have newer steady strategies soon, as Patache Digital is proposing new 2 more new steady strategies that are targeted at more niche but active communities, mainly SteadyMATIC and SteadyUNI. These proposals will go on-chain next week.

We will cover what steady strategies in Sommelier means in our video.

**‚û§ Takeaways from the Stablecoin Summit**

This week, Shade Protocol hosted a stablecoin summit that focuses on the current and future state of stablecoins in Cosmos, Ethereum and beyond, which saw participation from leading protocols such as Axelar, Kujira, Agoric and many more ‚Äî and here is a TLDR with some of the most interesting thoughts/findings that happened around it:

1. ‚ÄúThe biggest problem for decentralization is the frailty of human consciousness (ie. We aren‚Äôt aware of unit bias, which affects the way we denominate things)‚Äù ‚Äî Zaki
2. ‚ÄúThe end state for the best stablecoin should ideally be on-chain at about 100% CR because it‚Äôs the most exact capital efficient, solvent, safe and competitive type of currency‚Äù ‚Äî Sam
3. ‚ÄúWe have made great progress with stablecoins, and we just need to keep pushing forward with responsible methodologies while balancing the curve between crazy regulations and what we want. Let‚Äôs do right by people, and we will get there inch by inch‚Äù ‚Äî Dove

**Extra:** ‚ÄúNuon Finance is going to be launching a ‚Äòflatcoin‚Äô next month that is in simpler terms, a synthetic perpetual that is pegged to your cost of living‚Äù ‚Äî Stefan Rust

‚û§ **Other interesting happenings**

1. Kujira is going to open up ORCA‚Äôs liquidation queue for the wBNB USK market, and add wBNB as a collateral for USK.
2. $IBCX, the interchain index token for Cosmos that benchmarks the Cosmos system with a diversified portfolio of interchain assets that is governed by the ION DAO (wow that was long) is now in beta testing phase.
3. $MARS airdrop is coming soon for those who had $MARS and were affected during the UST depeg.
4. Interchain Name Service (ICNS) is now out, and you can mint your name for free!

## Conclusion

That marks the end of week 5. If you found this useful, I would really appreciate upvotes and please comment down below on what you think about this.

Video will be up on Flagship‚Äôs YouTube page in the next few days!

"My notes on the upcoming THORchain fork Maya Protocol, built w/ Cosmos SDK","PhotonMiles","2022-12-21 04:23:41","**Maya Protocol**

Been researching the new friendly fork of **THORchain** called **Maya Protocol**, built on Cosmos SDK. Wanted to share some notes in case others could benefit.

**Brief THORchain background**: THORchain is a web3 network used for direct, real, native, on-chain swaps between apex L1 assets.

Huh? Bottom line: it‚Äôs used to trade real coins like real $ETH for real $BTC, no wrappers, no centralized exchanges, no KYC, no gate-keepers, no custodians. Your keys, your coins.

It‚Äôs built using the Cosmos SDK (powers $ATOM, $OSMO, $JUNO, and the ill-fated $LUNA, among *many* others). This is a strong blockchain foundation to build with, allowing super-fast transactions with low gas fees and high security. Even though $LUNA‚Äôs stupid UST mint/burn design imploded, the network itself continued to work flawlessly! The tech is sound.

THORchain‚Äôs security model is proof-of-bond *instead* of either proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.

Proof-of-bond bottom line: node operators need to have skin in the game, in the form of a large amount of bonded capital, in order to participate. The native asset of THORchain, used to provide that bond, is called $RUNE. Nodes must have min. 300k $RUNE bonded. Max supply of all $RUNE is 500mil, all minted at genesis. No inflation.

For each pool of native L1 assets in the network, there is a matching value pool of $RUNE provided by standard liquidity providers (LP). This is what allows for the swaps.

You have $ETH and want $BTC? Come to an exchange like THORswap, trade that $ETH directly for $BTC; in the background the network sells your $ETH for $RUNE, moves the $RUNE value to the $BTC side, and swaps the $RUNE for $BTC. Pay just standard swap fees and appropriate network gas.

THORchain is NOT a bridge! There is NO wrapping of assets! There is no IOU-style CUSTODY of assets! Real coin A in, Real coin B out. The end.

Now on to **Maya Protocol**!

The core design is the same as THORchain, just replace $RUNE with $CACAO. Though $CACAO has a max supply of 100mil instead of $RUNE‚Äôs 500mil.

Why do a THORchain friendly fork at all? Bottom line: it needs a backup. But why? Some key reasons:

\- THORchain needs a backup as a universal backend provider of L1 asset swaps (such an important function needs decentralization itself!) We have got to stop relying on CEXes for this!

\- THORchain can‚Äôt grow fast enough to capture the entire addressable market by itself, and why leave it to other technologies? If both THORchain and Maya succeed, they re-enforce confidence in their model. It is a \*good thing\* to re-enforce THORchain‚Äôs first-mover advantage in this space!

\- THORchain has a transactions-per-second limit that will eventually be reached. More capacity will be needed.

\- Maya Protocol can have some overlap, but also focus on different markets/chains (maybe support for $OSMO instead of $ATOM for instance, or $MATIC instead of $AVAX)

So core design is the same. But what‚Äôs unique to Maya Protocol?

First, it has an additional token called $MAYA that has no analog on THORchain. $MAYA will be a revenue-share token (constantly capturing 10% of swap fees) with a fixed max supply of one million. It will help with initial funding and network bootstrapping, as well as developer incentivization. Keep in mind $MAYA is NOT a governance token in any way.

The Maya white paper describes a way to think about $MAYA in terms of a classic price/earnings ratio. It‚Äôs kind of like a stock with a dividend, since it has a fixed quantity and a fixed payout rate from a known revenue stream. They describe it with this formula:

P/E = $MAYA last public price / 10% \* Annualized Protocol Fee Revenue

Huh? P/E is a traditional way to value a company stock; the higher the P/E, the more ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù a stock is traditionally considered to be, meaning that there‚Äôs a good chance it will decrease in the future. Reverse also true. Alternatively a friendly interpretation of a high P/E is that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stock. No guarantees of course.

In the case of the S&amp;P 500, the average P/E over time has been around 13 to 15. $MAYA P/E remains to be seen!

Liquidity Provision on Maya

Maya Protocol will have LP pools just like THORchain. Where does the $BTC come from for people to swap on Maya Protocol? From people providing liquidity to pools in a 50-50 ratio of the $BTC (or whatever L1 asset) and $CACAO. For every $1 of $BTC the provide, they must also provide $1 of of $CACAO. Chances are they‚Äôll be able to enter/exit the LPs in any ratio they like (including BTC-only), but it will immediately be swapped into a 50-50 blend.

Why provide liquidity? To earn swap fees of course! What kind of rates? Well right now on THORchain you can get roughly 6% APR for the BTC-RUNE pool, 7.4% for ETH-RUNE, and a healthy 15% for BUSD-RUNE! I suspect relatively similar rates on Maya‚Äôs LP pools.

Now Maya is also moving a step further with their LP pools for the benefit of the node operators. In THORchain the node operators have to bond that huge chunk of $RUNE and can‚Äôt otherwise use it. In Maya Protocol on the other hand, the bonded $CACAO can \*also\* be used for LP provision! So those node operators can both bond their $CACAO in order to run a node \*and\* earn yield in LP pools with it. Nice!

There‚Äôs lots more detail to how nodes operate for the network (the incentive curve between LP and node bonding, slashing as a deterrent of bad acting, earnings-per-dollar differences depending on total bond, etc) but that‚Äôs even wonkier than we‚Äôre already being! So we‚Äôll leave that to the white paper for folks who need to go \*deep\* down the rabbit hole.

Last main point I want to cover from my notes is the AZTEC chain that they‚Äôre launching alongside Maya Protocol.

AZTEC Chain

This is going to be a fork of Terra with some custom tweaks. As mentioned earlier, UST had a crap mint/burn design, but the network itself is a rock. The silver lining (such as it is) from Terra‚Äôs collapse was the proof of durability and stability of the network. Everything went nuts when UST collapsed, but the network kept on going like a champ!

So why is Maya forking Terra to create their own additional blockchain? Good question! First and foremost it will provide a direct-attached DeFi space that is both connected \*and\* separate. Smart contracts gotta go \*somewhere\*, and we do NOT want them on Maya Protocol directly. It‚Äôs vital to essentially \*sandbox\* the smart contracts so that there is no direct smart contract risk to Maya Protocol itself. Maya Protocol is essential web3 infrastructure; it must have minimal risk.

AZTEC chain will have its own native $AZTEC token, and also provide a natural first space for the $CACAO token to discover DeFi purpose beyond simply bonding and LPing on Maya Protocol directly. $CACAO, like $RUNE, will have a deterministic minimum value due to how it works in the main protocol (necessarily $CACAO must at least equal the value of the bonded L1 assets, at a minimum). But there‚Äôs no reason it can‚Äôt have a \*higher\* value than that deterministic minimum, and giving it DeFi use cases will aid in putting upward pressure on that token value.

Also remember that $CACAO has a fixed total supply, and it will need to flow from Maya Protocol to AZTEC and incur slip fees along the way, providing earnings to Maya‚Äôs network. AZTEC will give the $CACAO token a natural first place to be used for lend/borrow, smart contract platforms, NFT trading, and any other typical Cosmos smart contract chain capability. Look to $JUNO, $KUJI, or even $OSMO for inspiration.

Ever hear of a rektdrop? It‚Äôs kind of like an airdrop consolation prize given to folks who held a token that tanked. Well, $LUNA and $UST sure tanked. Hard! The team at Maya is going to airdrop $AZTEC tokens to those of us (ugh, me included!) who got decimated by the LUNA collapse. Thanks guys!!

Okay, this has been a monster wrapped up in a whopper. There‚Äôs much more to learn yet, like $AZTEC tokenomics, how its validators will operate, who might develop there, etc. But let‚Äôs leave it here for now.

Final quick recap: Maya Protocol is a friendly fork of THORchain which empowers native direct L1 asset swaps, all on-chain, without any wrappers or bridges. Its primary tokens will be $CACAO (used for bonding and LPing) and $MAYA (a means of profit sharing). It will support $BTC and $ETH and other L1s to-be-determined. It‚Äôs based on the Cosmos SDK. In light of one centralized exchange collapse after another, we need it desperately! If you don‚Äôt want to be the prospector who went digging for gold but instead want to be the guy who sold the pick-axes, Maya is that pick-axe. It‚Äôs critical web3 infrastructure.

Whew! If you made it this far, I thank you! I‚Äôll post more as I learn it.","23","[""How does the protocol swap Rune for BTC without a custodial version or centralized entity?

"Validator Tokens in the Cosmos Ecosystem","Dry_Milk_5702","2022-12-19 19:11:56","I liked the idea that in the Cosmos ecosystem, the validator issued its own token PHMN. As I understand. First, the deligators receive these tokens. Secondly, they fill the liquidity pools of their PHMN/JUNO with a part of the validation profit and thus the price of the token rises. The third hodlers of PHMN participate in the decentralized management of the validator. And I was surprised that the price of this token rose to $40. I think this is a good initiative! Has anyone heard of other validators who do this?","4","[""Kleomedes is actually one of the first Validators to do this.\n\nI'm biased because I helped design the tokenomics for Kleo, but I have to warn you that the project you're talking about the tokenomics are heavily balanced in the project owner's favor. It might be looking good now, but it's a recipe for pump and dump, imo. Not trying to knock the project, but it sets off so many red flags to me.\n\nI think this style design has great potential for decentralizing Validators, but also has great potential to be abused. You have to either trust the validator isn't going to act against holder interest, or the validator has to operate with full transparency.\n\nFor example, these are the tokenomics and how/why the price will be what it will be upon release for Kleo:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlbbIjvLHlUtSBBYRwGNJcVKsTiupChS6pAvSZgg9XNpiLDJNGdJj5jBtwmIPU3rZmqNk-fY2p2fpk/pub\n\nAnd here are the validator revenue streams in full transparency:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ySP-zLVgpRZKp9ijP67CXyUPSiAG_YjvQVNarsCVy-I/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nAnd a fully functioning custom-built DAO framework with on-chain transparency:\n\nhttps://daodao.zone/dao/juno1mue2xdl05375tjc4njux5c6mkxltun3h0p33qtpx4utrwtnh949sxutcxy\n\nWe are in the process of launching a DAO constitution and a system of elected councils that manage the governance of each chain we validate.\n\nThe revenue share for holding Kleo gets paid directly in native chain tokens, not by pumping Kleo price. That means contributors earn Kleo for actually contributing, and those that stake Kleo get real-yield revenue. Not a pumped up governance token with little to no actual value backing it.\n\nThe entire *point* of a decentralized Validator community instead of a closed organization is to empower contributors to be effective at participating in keeping these chains healthy. Lower the bar for entry into network validation. The profits from validation are incentives to motivate that level of contribution.\n\n\nIf you're delegating to a Validator that issues a reward token, I highly recommend making sure they are transparent with how the tokenomics work, where the Validator profits go, and who has actual control over the entire thing. It is a system ripe for exploit, as validators can claim to be sharing profits through their own token, when in fact they are just pumping their delegations and funneling the profit into their pocket.\n\nEverything should be on-chain, transparent, and as trustless as possible.\n\nI would love to see more Validators follow Kleomedes and do this system right. But I'm nervous about groups doing it the other way and giving ppl a bad taste about Validators with their own token and a revenue share."",""These are not bad, they could potentially have great use cases in the future. However, these are a recipe for centralization if one validator token becomes the most popular due to a highly valuable use case, then the majority of staking funds could flow to their validator to earn validator tokens. \n\nThis may not be as big of a deal if only 1 validator token gains serious demand, but if 2 or 3 others do as well, the oligarchy grows more centralized. Plus third party risk grows exponentially in this *theoretical* scenario as well. Censorship and relative anonymity is what should be on every projects mind, if they wish for long term, sufficient, decentralization.""]"

547,945.20 tokens \* 0.78$ is 420'000$ per day in costs to ""run"" Osmosis, even at this bear market, that is just insane..

Atom is also expensive to ""run"", however the difference besides the cost/mcap is WHO is paying the cost.

If we inflate Atom into being worthless to reward something, most of the 2.6 billion in value loss, would be paid by the Atom holders themselves losing value, so who cares go ahead.

However, when Osmo inflates, due to how large % of the tokens are in LP's, the cost is actually ""socialized"" and to a large extent paid for by the other tokens they managed to ""lure"" in to pool against Osmo losing their value by selling Osmo into the pools.

For this cosmos ecosystem to work, we cant have the leading ""exchange"" basically draining this much value from  the other participants in the ecosystem, there needs to be some change. The exchange system of the cosmos needs lower costs.

Maybe an ICS chain that have less validator costs, and a open source orderbook exchange which requires less tokens locked up thus less need for ""incentives"", could be a way out?

Printing money is never free money, the question is who is paying for it. And for osmosis it is the cosmos ecosystem that pays a large chunk, without even noticing.

"Creating good Blockchain Governance","Jcook_14","2022-12-18 15:35:49","What could encourage good Governance? I‚Äôm toying with an additional concept, that tags along with the Sovereign Cosmos Hub Governance chain idea, and how we could encourage good Governance instead of the spam or incoherent, unproductive props we sometimes have in the Cosmos.

**This idea has a few key concepts**:

1. A central hub, this could be synonymous with the ‚Äúcensus‚Äù I mentioned in my previous post. (similar to Commonwealth but, in this case, Cosmos Hub specific)
2. The deposit of a Governance proposal to be raised significantly (let‚Äôs say the deposit stays proportional to a certain percent of the circulating supply of the Governance tokens. I‚Äôll say .5% of the total supply at any given time with the deposit being fixed at the time the proposal hits the governance hub for, review, negotiation, debate and deposit). Delegators will be allowed to easily deposit tokens to crowdfund proposals to become active on chain proposals.
3. The ability to incentivize delegators to take an active role in Governance, by encouraging and empowering good Governance and productive proposals. Being active in Governance should be rewarded for delegators in some capacity, otherwise we will continue to have low quality Governance and spam proposals.
4. An automatic 10% slashing penalty for the deposit of a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo with veto‚Äù proposal. This could limit the willingness of depositors and proposal issuers alike, to send out spam or incoherent proposals.

**Explanation of the various Governance processes and concepts**

*Central Hub of Governance*:

* The Governance process would have to shift away from Commonwealth, and move to a central hub, built to interact with the Cosmos Hub and the Governance Chain. This hub would have to have a few key characteristics that are monitored and in many cases, will trigger a reactionary execution by the Cosmos Hub or the Governance chain.

This hub would require that in order for any proposal to be listed on chain, the final draft of the proposal should be listed on the hub. The reason you want the final draft to be uploaded to the hub, is because it will be going on chain if it receives the proper amount of deposits, and if there is a chance that the deposits could be slashed (touched on in the Slash explanation later in the post), you probably want the highest level of proposal you can have, being deposited into.

*Deposit Raised Significantly*:

* The next concept is the drastic addition to the deposit amount required to allow a prop to be listed on-chain. The amount will actually not be a fixed rate, like the current 64 ATOM deposit amount. Instead, it will be a going percentage, like the previously mentioned .5% of the circulating supply of the Governance chains token, at any given time. The reasoning behind this is, that the more of the Governance token is issued, the higher you would want the deposit to be, to encourage a more community driven approach. The fact that there is no airdrop, there is only the ability to recieve these Governance tokens, from the beginning, is based on a set amount of inflation, this fluctuating deposit amount will limit the capability of an entity to single-handedly meet the deposit requirement. (They can still buy the needed amount, but buying or acquiring .5% of the networks tokens, would certainly come at a decently high cost, so they would really have to feel the need to single-handed acquire the tokens instead of creating the proposal in a manner that would encourage community crowdfunding).

In order to post a proposal, they will want to create a meaningful proposal with the backing of the community, to create the highest likelihood that the proposal get posted on chain and also passes, as to not have the deposit get slashed (will be explained in further detail in the last explanation).

*Incentives for Good Governance*:

* In order to encourage good Governance, we may not be able to rely on one‚Äôs ‚Äúcivic duty‚Äù to be the most encouraging model. What if there was an incentive model to reward good Governance, just as there is an incentive to not deposit into unreasonable proposals? I see this in the same light of incentive structure as, Validators running the chain in a truthful manner to get block rewards but if they commit an act on chain that the network doesn‚Äôt approve of, they will be slashed and jailed.

The incentive structure I would imagine best would be one with 40% of block rewards being distributed to ATOM delegators via ICS, and the other 60% being distributed through the Governance incentives model. So in turn, the incentive structure of the chain is Governance focused, since the delegation of those tokens should go towards depositing into reasonable proposals, rather than simply staking to secure the network. In this model, there should be no developer incentives, there should be no airdrop, there should be no LP incentives. The genesis incentives will distribute in that 40/60 model from the beginning. (in this 40/60 model, I see an issue with how governance vote incentives get distributed, if there has not been a recent vote. These 60% of the block rewards could distribute in a few ways. They could distrubute to the last passing votes depositers, or they could be held on chain, and build up, until a vote is voted yes. In which they will be distributed to depositers. I‚Äôm open to suggestions on this.

* **Slashing**: Slashing or perhaps, the threat of being slashed, is an important function of validating. If you misbehave you get slashed. Blockchains can‚Äôt afford mistakes, or wasted block producers. They need trustworthy Validators, who don‚Äôt make attempts to mislead the network. Delegators should also be held to this standard in the face of important network activities.

So, the way I see delegators in this model of slashing is very similar to how I viewed the incentive structure but with reversed roles. If you deposit into a proposal, and that proposal fails (no, no with veto or not meeting quorum), your deposit will be slashed. However, I do believe there could be benefit in adding in the abstain button as a preventative measure for slashing.

An example:

The vote was heavily debated, but the overall verdict appears to be ‚Äúno‚Äù. In this case the ‚Äúyes‚Äù voters can switch their vote to ‚Äúabstain‚Äù and if the abstain vote hits 34% before the voting period ends, then the slashing function doesn‚Äôt activate. This gives the opportunity for mercy on posts that are not spam and not malicious, and rather was a simple failed negotiation or failed understanding.

While we should incentivize good governance and punish wasteful proposals, we should keep our network open to reasonable debate, and reasonable debate should never be punished. This abstain function in the slashing model will give the voters a decision as to whether the failed proposal deserves to be slashed or simply failed and no slash.

**Conclusion**:

Blockchains tend to lack good, productive or meaningful Governance. While I do believe the Cosmos Hub has the best version of blockchain Governance, spam and time wasting proposals find their way into Governance frequently. These wasteful proposals waste blockspace, they waste the time of the community and they waste the gas to vote No or No with veto them. This means to me, we could find a better, more efficient system to handling Governance and the proposal process.

I found the idea of incentive's in a Governance system, to be a pretty interesting thought experiment and I think it could provide deep value to use this as a tool for better Governance. Whether this happens in the way I have envisioned it, or a totally new and better way, the idea behind incentivized Governance could hold weight as a meaningful way to help promote a healthier and more efficient Governance structure.

For further context into my rationale behind Governance, Decentralization and the Governance Chain, I have multiple other posts that elaborate more on how I got to this post. I would love to hear thoughts about those as well, and what parts of my idea may or may not be necessary.

"The Cosmos and a Sovereign Governance Module. The complicated ‚Äúhow to‚Äù for decentralizing The Cosmos.","Jcook_14","2022-12-15 23:32:30","**Governance module**: a sovereign blockchain, that relies on Cosmos ICS. Pays a set inflation with no airdrop of any kind, rather the inflation at genesis and onward, goes toward delegator and validator rewards via ICS. The purpose is to allow for greater, more Sophisticated data availability and execution of Governance on The Hub.

**Utility**:

* Governance chain token is used to pay to propose Governance Proposals (IBC‚Äôd to ATOM chain for this purpose)
* Used to pay for slashing proposals  (mainnet Governance chain)
* Acts as a co-chain that executes the Governance for the ATOM chain, but as a sovereign entity. Sort of a data availability layer/Oracle of sorts, but for the ATOM chain specifically. And this sovereign chain can ececute Governance on the Hub using IBC functionality.
* Token is paid to ATOM stakers from staking via ICS.

**Why a Sovereign entity?**

In the grand scheme of blockchains, and stated by Nick White (Celestia) in his Cryptocito interview on Dec. 14th around 8 minutes into the interview. Nick mentioned that blockchains consists of three main functions:

1. Consensus
2. Data Availability
3. Execution

This premise in blockchain is important to know, because these issues all deal with the code itself, and each of these sections can add an additional level of complexity to the code. Which, thereby add an additional level of difficulty to the validating of the network. This makes a Validators jobs harder and makes the Validators less likely to accept a proposal that would increase validator difficulty and complexity, while also decreasing the relative power over all, for validators. This creates an issue, where Validators need to be incentivized to not only run the Governance module that‚Äôs limiting their power, but also be insured that they validate such a network in a trustless, honest manner as well.

**Example of restriction and some of its architecture**:

\-One of the restrictions that would be added to the Validators, if they chose to accept the Governance module, would be a code section that says they cannot hastily upgrade the Cosmos code, while the delegators backs are turned. This could be done through architecting a module on the sovereign governance chain, that executes the ability for the code to be uploaded, after a certain amount of time has been spent on a specific Testnet, 2 months (or 2 months worth of blocks for example). This could also act as a barrier to entry, for validators to upload code or upgrade the code.

How could this be set up?

It could start like this. In order to upload a prop, you must fill out the prop census, that allows you to explain the prop and upload the Prop to the chain. If a prop is accepted, a Testnet must be created and registered with the Governance chain, with a requirement that it‚Äôs labeled under the same number or ‚ÄúProp ID‚Äù as the Prop number and must be IBC enabled to the Governance chain. This is done to establish and verify that the Testnet has officially begun, beginning the count down of the block requirement. (If this Testnet is not IBC enabled to the Governance module using the prop label, which is the number and details of the Prop, then the ability to upload that upgrade will be disabled until the Testnet is properly formed and being accounted for by the Governance prop).

(**Side note but relevant to the discussion**: In this model, we could also require certain lines of code to be added to the census. That way, the Governance module can recognize and deny any upgrade that would upload that line of code behind the backs of delegators. Effectively ensuring that the will of the delegators is being followed.)

This is only one example of how this governance chain could possibly interact and ensure the will of the delegators, while also providing value to the validators and delegators alike, with value derived from its utility as the de facto Governance token of the ATOM blockchain.

(**Sidenote**: this Testnet function, is relevant to my *second post* that I have included, which also adds in the emergency vote for validators to bypass the Testnet phase, with a vote from the delegators that renders the Testnet phase, effectively over and any emergency upgrades to be available for execution.)

**Adding the ability and right for delegators to slash certain validators when deemed necessary**:

Another check and balance here could be where the delegators can vote directly on the governance module to slash a Cosmos Hub validator if 67% come to agreement that a certain validator should be slashed for a particular reason. This could prove to be an important function of a governance network and could be automated to not rely on any party other than the delegators. For example: once the delegators vote passes with a ‚Äúyes‚Äù, the governance module chain executes the slash. This (like the rest of these ideas) would be extremely complex IBC transactions that would need to happen, and with how much data and code complexity would be necessary, this may not be very plausible. But could be possible given the right technology advances in the IBC.

However, this delegator right to slash would be an interesting way for delegators to check the power of certain validators if deemed necessary. I have this as a high quorum item as well, due to the level of power this could give, we would need high level of agreement in a slashing scenario. Also, this would need a specific Governance process, as it is not a ‚Äúregular‚Äù governance proposal. So I‚Äôm open to suggestions on how a delegators right to slash and a ‚ÄúDirect Delegator Slashing Process‚Äù, could work in practice, but I‚Äôll keep thinking on how the structure could go.

**What gives this Governance token value?**

It‚Äôs main token utility is to be IBC‚Äôd over to the Hub, to use to pay for Governance proposals as well as used on its mainnet, to be used for other types of critical voting a proposal functions. It would act as a crucial piece of governance infrastructure for the Hub, and assuming the Hub gains value, it‚Äôs fair to assume that the Governance on the Hub and Governance chain and token, will gain in value as well.

**Is this automated Governance model better as a sovereign chain or should this be done on the Hub directly?**

This is at its roots, a two part question:

* Should the Hub stay as minimal as possible in its code base?
* Would the added complexity to the code, be acceptable for Validators to accept with no added incentive structure?

**Should the Hub stay as minimal as possible**

It is my opinion that the Hub ought to stay minimal in its code base. The Hub needs to be a consistent block producing machine, with as close to zero risk of failing as possible. The Hub is a relic and the genesis of the IBC. It should be reliable to be the safe haven of the Greater Cosmos as a whole, if chains go down, the ability to consolidate into the Hub for safety is the strong foundation the greater Cosmos ecosystem needs. So with that, while I personally believe that the current Cosmos Governance system needs some help. I do not believe that these automated governance structures, are viable to be executed on a chain like the Hub. Rather I believe that a sovereign chain, dedicated strictly to execution of Governance leveraging IBC functionality and ICS for security, is likely the best scenario.

I am well aware that the current iteration of IBC would be unable to execute such transactions and a lot more development and architecture is needed, but there‚Äôs a unique opportunity on the IBC, that no other chain has. Sovereign cross chain transactions could allow for better, more decentralized and censor resistant Governance.

**Would the added complexity to the code, be acceptable for Validators to accept with no added incentive structure?**

The next issue to tackle, and another reason I believe a Sovereign chain may be our best bet. The validators will need to accept the added complexity and that would be a challenge if we ask them to accept all of this complexity, with no incentive to do so. These transactions will likely be very complex and the code to do so, could take significant resources. So instead of asking them to accept it directly on the Hubs code, they could instead onboard a sovereign chain via ICS, that is coded specifically with the purpose of executing the Hubs automated Governance functionality. This chains token will have utility through being the token used to propose standard Governance on the Hub. It will also have voting structures or protocols on mainnet, that allow it to be used for automated governance on its mainnet as well, such as the voting for the delegators slashing of certain Hub validators.

**Conclusion**

While I acknowledge that this is a truly lofty goal and a large change to the Governance structure of the Cosmos as we know it, I believe we have a centralization problem that can‚Äôt be solved with more validators. More validators a can certainly help. But, automated Governance that is at the base code level, that allows for a high degree of checks and balances between delegators and validators is the solution in my eyes. The most decentralized part of the Hub is it‚Äôs delegation, why not find a way to use that as a tool to make the network unable to be censored.

Anyway, I keep seeing all this ICS hype &amp; it looks pretty cool, but what am I missing? How easy is it to try with a Keplr wallet for example? Is it just like delegating to any other validator?

They will simply be added to your rewards when you claim, but in their native token form, not paid in ATOM. \n\n*Stuff no one talks about*: ICS has general limitations, as it will add complexity to the job of the Hubs validator set, every time a new chain is onboarded. That‚Äôs why every chain that hooks into ICS will need to pass through Governance, rather than it being a permissionless system. The chains can also be kicked from ICS, through governance, if they do not prove to hold enough value for their respective spot, being validated by the Cosmos Hub validator set. One thing that I think is important to understand is that, ICS really has a theoretical limit, due to the added work for validators, I‚Äôm just not sure what that limit truly is. I‚Äôve heard 16-20 chains, are the theoretical upper bound in ICS‚Äôs current iteration. But I could be off base with that, that‚Äôs just what I believe I have heard through the grapevine. New developments in both ICS complexity and in validating complexity could increase the number of chains, but like everything in Crypto, it‚Äôs gonna take time and research.\n\nICS is impressive and will, IMO, likely be a great value driver.

Quite a few people there are into Cosmos but they've only just gotten some space to take on another project - and they want to explore something with Cosmos.

Once again, the goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 7 minutes every week! So, grab a coffee and let‚Äôs dive in.

**‚û§ Proposal 88 ‚Äî which aims to increase the Hub‚Äôs tax from 2% to 10% ‚Äî is now live until 20th December**

In the past few weeks, there have been discussions ongoing to increase the community tax of the Hub from 2% to 10% ‚Äî in direct response to ATOM 2.0‚Äôs funding model.

Just this week, the proposal went live, to change this parameter.

According to the proposal, ATOM already has a treasury that is used for past endavours, funded by taxation on a per-block basis. By increasing the taxation for the Hub, this will increase the inflow of the treasury for future funding of endavours, so there will be no need to create a new entity or mint new ATOMs for treasury funding.

**‚û§ Improved developing experience**

The developer experience within Cosmos has seen a massive upgrade this week, with Composable Finance launching a CW development solution that saves time for developers, and Tendermint announcing the details of IBC-go‚Äôs scheduled upgrade to v7.0.0, which incorporates client refactor work to make light client development easier.

**‚û§ The battle of the giants continues**

Kujira‚Äôs battle with Osmosis continues, as both DEXes introduce fresh developments to widen their capabilities in the Cosmos ecosystem.

Kujira has just announced this week that they are allowing the minting of $USK with $wETH as collateral, and partners up with Axelar to allow for a one-click solution to bring your $ETH from MetaMask to Kujira, which is pretty cool.

Meanwhile, Osmosis launched Stableswap, which allows traders to swap large amounts of stable assets (yes, including wrapped assets) with minimum price impact.

‚û§ **Other interesting happenings**

1. Inter Protocol ($IST) Economic Committee has voted to establish new minting limits based on their evaluation, after including $DAI in the Parity Stability Module (PSM).
2. Flipside has now included Cosmos in their datasets, and you can easily query for trends, investigate activity and chart the future of IBC for free.
3. It looks like dYdX is about to be launched soon, with their very not-so-subtle tweet, saying that dYdX is about 92% to launch‚Ä¶ dYdX admins in this Reddit, wen launch?

2.) I hear about this quicksilver? Is that going to be added I presume under ""discover apps"" when it launches? (very soon apparently the 16th) I'll have to look into this, and should have instead of asking so no worries if you don't feel like answering.  


3.) What is your preferred method of buying the various tokens under the umbrella of Cosmos?  
Do you buy a stable coin on a CEX to transfer over to Keplar and exchange on one of the apps? Or a different crypto to do this like pure ATOM? Basically am I going to continue using CRO defi wallet to transfer over Keplar or is there another method I don't know about?

"CLOBs the future of on-chain trading?","PhotonMiles","2022-12-14 08:40:37","First we saw Kujira FIN on the Cosmos.  Next Sei Network is going to bring Vortex, and presumably other, CLOB style DEXes to the Cosmos!

This is a fantastic innovation as it is yet one more reason to stay on-chain and off of any centralized exchange.  CLOBs on chain are awesome because they don't completely depend on liquidity pools or inflationary token rewards to facilitate trades.  Instead they just match buyers to sellers and execute at the price that each counterparty is willing to pay.

A downside of course is that low volume can lead to trades waiting a long time to fill.  But as popularity increases this problem eases.  Also selective curation of available pairs can help reduce the chances of long-tail assets sitting around in stale orders with no counter-party.

Given Sei's purpose-built trading blockchain, and the strong sentiment turn \*against\* centralized exchanges, I suspect there will likely be plenty of activity. At least I think this is going to be true for popular pairs like $ATOM/$JUNO or $USDC/$OSMO etc.

And then depending on what kind of EVM links they can achieve using partners like Axelar and Evmos, all sorts of high desirability assets might start trading regularly on the Cosmos!  This can only be a Good Thing!

Excited for where this goes.","4","[""It is a common misconception that Kujira Fin was the first CLOB dex in the cosmos ecosystem (it doesn't help that this false claim is the first thing you see when you go to their app).

The hybrid model avoids the bootstrapping issues around attracting liquidity. Kujira already had to transition to the hybrid model to tighten spreads on Fin."",""What is CLOB? Seem like order book?

Maya Protocol is a decentralized liquidity network that is powered by $CACAO, our native token. Our initial Exchange enables non-custodial, non-KYC'd, fast, and efficient cross-chain swaps between native assets. 

Why we need more DEXes like this?

A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates without a central authority or intermediary. This means that users can directly trade cryptocurrencies with each other, without the need for a third-party platform to facilitate the transactions.

A cross-chain DEX is a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies that are built on different blockchain networks. This is important because most cryptocurrencies are built on their own unique blockchain networks, and these networks are not typically compatible with each other. This means that users who want to trade cryptocurrencies that are built on different blockchain networks would typically have to go through a centralized exchange, which can be inconvenient and potentially risky.

A cross-chain DEX provides a solution to this problem by allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies that are built on different blockchain networks directly with each other. This can make the process of trading cryptocurrencies more efficient and secure, as it eliminates the need for a centralized intermediary.","8","[""What does ¬´¬†friendly fork¬†¬ª mean?\n\nThor devs abandoning rune and moving to comsos?"",""What's the point of your team forking THORChain?

I have tried to look at AquaDAO (on Juno) and their information is somewhat limited, I can't even figure out if they have a discord, no whitepaper/tokenomics. Any information is appreciated. Thanks.","2","[""I am following Aqua a while now and they have a Discord (https://discord.gg/a5KHXfsj) but I am unsure if I can recommend this project since (as you said) it is not very transparent and well documented yet. Aqua claims to be also a kind of consultant to other charity projects like Casa or Sunset to help them starting off on Juno. They do airdrops but their distribution seems to be not well organized, like the whole project in general. Moreover, I don‚Äôt like how they‚Äôre pushing their project. There are a lot of page long announcements with the same content over and over, promoting also some NFT sales and talking about how much coins you get when you buy them. Too much of a sale out for my taste. Best you join the Discord and decide for yourself. I think I will unstake from their validator the end of the year but still watch where they go."",""Have a look at Angel protocol. They have a Juno validator iirc."",""A few I can think of:\n\n- RHINO's wildlife fund\n\n- EcoStake.net's ecology fund\n\nAnd some energy/ecology-related ones:\n\n- The *other* ECO Stake (yes, there are two *different* Ecostakes on Juno) who does carbon offsets, and who developed Restake.app!\n\n- Windpowerstake runs their infrastructure off green energy sources\n\n- Earth Positive\n\n- Empower Chain (plastics, sustainability)"",""While not charity, WYND DAO on Juno is creating multichain DeFi protocols. 25% of the fees generated from these will be allocated to an environmental subDAO that will invest in projects improving the environment.""]"

Cosmic Horizon is a strategy space MMRPG developed by Qwoyn Studios based on the Cosmos SDK. Cosmic Horizon takes inspiration from adventure and strategy games of the 1990s and updates established concepts with a modern blockchain-based approach. The main elements of the game consist of a Universe (divided into thousands of separate sectors) and elements within it, namely Players, Ships, Planets (including special planets) and Ports (including special ports). Players will interact with the world and each other to mine resources and exert control over sections of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Several interesting personalities have signed up for the project, here are some of them:

* IBC FTW - PhonikG
* Advisor to the u/cosmos \- Jack Zampolin
* And other Influencers

Cosmic Horizon draws some inspiration from classic adventure and strategy games of the 1990s, but utilizes a modern game engine and blockchain infrastracture to provide a modern and dynamic gaming expirience that aligns with the sensibilities of traditional gamers, while requiring little if any expirience in blockchain

Cosmic Horizon has secured the support of some interesting projects, such as Stargaze, Regen Network and others:

&amp;#x200B;

Cosmic Horizon places players in an unexplored galaxy, filled with planets, ships, trading outposts, and space stations to discover (and potentially conquer). To prosper, players earn funds by buying and selling commodities, acquiring and upgrading their ships, and developing planets and other fortifications. Players may choose to form syndicates and alliances to pursue galactic hegemony collectively or grow and build as lone privateers, Ultimately players will develop their own unique strategies and styles of play in the open universe of Cosmic Horizon.

The project is currently undergoing an [Ambassador program](https://cosmic-horizon.crew3.xyz/invite/MFZDGYC9NceV50JkblQmt), which does not involve so many people and the chances of getting coins is quite good. I advise to continue to follow the game, help her in development and I think she will be able to surprise us!

&amp;#x200B;

Read our notes below to learn more

&amp;#x200B;

**About Laura**

* A genesis validator in Secret Network.
* Very passionate about the technology and helped improve the developer experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**About Darren**

* Started his journey as one of the very first Secret Agents for Secret Network.
* He worked as an advisor for Fortune 500 companies for text transformation.
* His friend recommended him to check out $SCRT Network.
* Started making educational infographics for people joining the network.
* Part of the team that spearheads the efforts to make Secret University the one place for developers to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

**About Alex**

* Has been with $SCRT Network for more than a year.
* Started during the time where committees were at the forefront of the network.
* Helping out in the education committee under Darren.
* Worked in the traditional software engineering industry.

&amp;#x200B;

**About DDT**

* Developing on $SCRT Network for over a year.
* Started to develop the random number generator a year and a half ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**Secret University**

* The whole vision is to become an ever-evolving resource for any developer who‚Äôs interested in building privacy protecting applications on $SCRT Network.
* It‚Äôs an environment that allows students to explore their interests then learn from very knowledgeable professors, make friends and embark on new experiences.
* Learning can be a very easy journey that can start from hand holding to a point where students start working on projects or on more advanced concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why it started**

* They wanted to make it as easy as possible, fun to develop and have a place where people could come and the idea of decentralized learning.
* Having the resources covering different topics is important.
* Senior developers were spending the majority of their time in Discord answering the same entry-level introductory questions to developers who wanted to learn.
* It was challenging for new developers to ask somebody who they respected and was so respected in the community because there may be a little bit of anxiety to ask a simple question.

 

**Things to look forward to**

* Already soft launched the initial platform.
* Will wait for the Secret Summit to announce the launch of the university.
* Launched an introductory course material.
* One of the initial materials is the Secret Pathways, a high level overview of technicalities behind $SCRT Network, architectural components and pre-requisites for a developer to get started.
* Secret Counter Box is a git pod environment or workspace that launches and gets the local Secret blockchain going, it deploys the initial contract and launches an app server.
* The second milestone is to focus on establishing the knowledge library.
* They want the library to be more robust with a lot of content that people can pull on and a little bit more of advanced learning.
* Working on integrating some other projects that also have educational material focused.
* Thinking about the processes on how to incentivize these new developers to create this content.
* Working on how to connect developers together so they can find their teams and jobs within the network.

&amp;#x200B;

**Secret Agents**

* The agents have been amazing in terms of helping spread awareness of the university, be the social presence around the network and collate a funnel for new talent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q&amp;A**

***Q: If you could see any application built for Secret that has not been built yet, what would that application be and why do you like to see it?***

* Excited for the Secret DNS.
* Have a single place where all the bounties are hosted.
* Insurance for DeFi.
* More games on Secret Network.

&amp;#x200B;

***Q: Do you guys see the Secret University being the source of truth for new developers?***

* We are a source of truth.
* Would like to see Secret Labs take over developer documentation so that developer docs become this really technical key piece of documentation that people can rely on.

I‚Äôm trying to still wrap my head around liquid staking and it‚Äôs benefits. 

So, say I stake ATOM with Stride, and ATOM goes on a crazy pump at some point and I want to take some profits via getting my ATOM back. I then take my stATOM and instead of unbonding it like normal I flip it back to ATOM on Osmosis to avoid the usual bonding period. 

At this point, what do I get?

Just my ATOM back? 
ATOM + rewards?
Or how does this work?

Over time 1 stAtom will be worth more and more Atom. They are advertising 17% so for simplicity, if you converted 1 atom to 1 stAtom, after a year, your stAtom would now be worth 1.17 Atom. If you unbond through Stride and wait the 21 days you will get the current conversion rate. When you sell on Osmosis or any other swap, you will get market exchange rate. This could be higher or lower than than the base rate depending on if people are buying or dumping. Generally though, it will be close to the default rate usually a little under since you're paying for the convenience of immediately cashing out.

Furthermore, they use assumptions about the \""probability\"" of \""most users\"" unstaking \""at the same time\"".\n\nIf we learned anything with LUNA, it should be it is NOT about \""most users\"" but the users with the most assets (or just enough to cause depegging, which are vastly different amounts and can be obtained through leverage anyway for the purpose of intentional depegging for a manipulated short).  \n\n\nI had been following the Anchor Forum thread on that concern a few months before the crash and exited a massive position at \\~$104 per LUNA and I owe every bit of that blessing to the very, very smart quant forum members.

"Liquid Staking; it‚Äôs benefits &amp; drawbacks","JessicaLevi13","2022-12-10 16:40:27","

Liquid Staking is similar to regular staking but has an added advantage of issuing derivative tokens(eg.stTokens) to users which represent their underlying staked tokens.

These derivative tokens are liquid and can be traded.

Liquid staking allows crypto stakers to continue to make transactions even with the tokens that they are staking.¬†

Some users complain about having to lock up their assets without having access to liquidity until the bonding time ends, this is where liquid staking comes in.

Benefits;
It provides liquidity to staked assets.
It allows users to earn additional yield rewards with the use of derivative tokens.
The derivative tokens can be exchanged for the staked assets at any time.

Drawbacks;
Just like regular staking, liquid-staked assets are subject to market sentiments and conditions.
Different platforms offering liquid staking services have varying yield rewards (this also happens in regular staking).

It is believed that liquid staking is poised to expand concurrently with the larger #DeFi movement due to its objective of fostering decentralization and accessibility as well as collecting #staking incentives on top.
DeFi in its most pure form is liquid stakingüëå.

Some Liquid staking protocols include;

@LidoFinance","10","[""Two for the advantages column:\n\n* auto-compounding.\n* calculating taxable income is far easier."",""Another drawback is that liquid staked assets may not be able to be redeemed for their underlying assets in case of a bankruptcy. In such a scenario, the liquid staked asset is essentially worthless which is why it is so important to assess for yourself if the risk is worth the reward. \n\n\nSome liquid staking assets might have lengthy (multiple weeks) unbonding times for the underlying asset. The unbonding times often correspond to the time it would take to unstake the actual asset. If waiting the unbonding period is not possible, you are subject to the exchange rate between the liquid staking token and its corresponding token, this trade usually comes at a premium. \n\n\nThere are risks involved in liquid staking, carefully weigh the risk vs. reward.""]"

"How important is education in Web3 infrastructure?","ReveloIntel","2022-12-09 21:56:07","In this episode, host Nadia Bajuelo speaks with [Greg Osuri](https://twitter.com/gregosuri), Founder of [Akash Network](https://twitter.com/akashnet_) and [Amy James](https://twitter.com/AmyofAlexandria), of [Web3 Working Group](https://twitter.com/web3wg), to discuss the importance of educating the public and regulators about web3 infrastructure and how they play a role apart from DeFi.

&amp;#x200B;

Read our notes below to learn more

&amp;#x200B;

**Privacy discussion**

* There‚Äôs a war between advocates of privacy and advocates of surveillance.
* There‚Äôs a lot of structural failure that‚Äôs starting to surface.
* The fact that Consensys has a database that contains users‚Äô IP addresses and transaction history is fundamentally dangerous.
* Akash Network creates a code that cannot collect information and cannot impose any censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

**Console update**

* Excited to have a web-based console that makes spinning up a RPC node or validator node super simple.
* It‚Äôs currently in private beta and will be launched very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ecosystem update**

* Cloud Moss launched alert systems.
* Luna forgo is a community member who came up with Akash terraform provider.
* Moonby‚Äôs is migrating their NFT project and 3D world to Akash.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bear market thoughts**

* The amount of desire to be private and to be sovereign is just great.
* Bear market is just silence.
* Focus on delivering value, users and building.

&amp;#x200B;

**Amy James‚Äô background**

* Co-Executive Director of Web3 Working Group.
* Web3 Working Group is a non-profit organization providing education about how Web3 infrastructure will decentralize the web and permanently restore user control of cyberspace.
* Co-Founder of Open Index Protocol.
* Previously worked in non-profit arts, organization and politics as an independent writer and director.
* Got into crypto because her husband read the $BTC whitepaper over Christmas of 2013.
* Created a ‚ÄúWhat kind of internet do you want?‚Äù series which shows all of the basic things in order to understand how Web3 is so different.

&amp;#x200B;

**About Web3 Working Group**

* The mission is to educate the public and regulators about Web3.
* The regulations need to accommodate Web3‚Äôs needs for infrastructure.
* Support developers with the resources they need to build fully decentralized applications.

 

**Thoughts on tokens**

* The Open Index Protocol has a specification that uses components involving tokens, a blockchain for the indexing, used file storage and there‚Äôs token orchestration involved but the protocol itself      doesn‚Äôt have a token.
* There‚Äôs an interesting project being worked on called Solid social linked data and it doesn‚Äôt have a token attached to it.
* There needs to be space for machina to machine-like transactions for token orchestrated networks to be able to do things behind the scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Relationship of regulators and Web3**

* Things are moving forward in a positive way.
* Unpredictable enforcement of the SEC has really held back the industry‚Äôs growth in some ways.
* There‚Äôs interesting data based on Github that shows developer activity in the U.S. is declining compared to other countries.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts on sentiment towards infrastructure**

* Cloud processing, file storage, video transcoding, API calls and context indexing are examples of important infrastructure that most people rely upon day in and day out.
* In Web3, the incentives that are in play means that users get that incredible dream of what the web would be, connecting people and ideas around the world.
* Web3 is defining technological revolution.
* A lot of AI stuff is closed-source and it serves as an inherent danger.
* Infrastructure is the foundation of prosperity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Amy‚Äôs first encounter of Akash**

* Got aware of it because of the Web3 Working Group.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q&amp;A**

***Q: How do you get away from the centralized cloud when a lot of validators set up their instances on the major cloud players?***

* If you‚Äôre setting up a validator on a single cloud provider, you are at the risk of censorship and centralized failures.
* Centralized structures, especially when they get large, get very inefficient and the experience is not very optimal.
* Akash is offering a solution that addresses the stability and price.

&amp;#x200B;

***Q: Are the issues of Alameda influential or consequential to the framework and steps of Akash in general? What does Akash hold in its fundamentals to keep transparency and public trust?***

* Akash has not been directly affected by the FTX downfall.
* It‚Äôs important now to decouple Akash from the rest of the financial narrative.
* There‚Äôs nothing we can hide in Akash network because it's a public blockchain, anyone can use it and it‚Äôs governed by token holders.
* Overlock Labs doesn‚Äôt have the power to swing a vote but it contributes a lot.
* Next year, we are going to focus more on community-first driven development.
* We want to enable a financing mechanism that‚Äôs directly tied onchain.

 

***Q: How do I tie up my dashboard only to myself through using VPN without exposing it to the internet?***

* A part of our roadmap is a global virtual private networking that serves as an abstraction layer on top of Akash deployment that connects and you can totally have a VPN tunnel to your private      network.
* In order to realize the full version of Akash, we need a lot of people working on it.
* One of the big things we‚Äôre going to be working on next year is riding the spec for a virtual private network and having the spec publicly go online.
* There‚Äôs a lot of experimentation with kubernetes in Docker so one can technically deploy a Docker container with a kubernetes control plane on it and have Cube CDL access then you have complete control over networking.

&amp;#x200B;

***Q: How do you see the Web3 industry for the next 3 to 5 years?***

* There‚Äôs quite a lot of interest from the big guys in Web3.
* Web3 allows competitors to collaborate with each other which is amazing.
* In the next 2 to 3 years, we‚Äôre going to see a lot of enterprise adoption in Web3.
* In 5 years, we‚Äôre going to see a lot of consolidation and it will be so embedded into infrastructure.
* There was a poll that said something like 76% of the people don‚Äôt like the effect that Web2 is having on their lives.

Connect wallets and it will show you the path with fee totals...I used it many times, or used the path that it gave me on my own. I moved USDC (not sure if Kraken has it) but sent USDC out of exchange via Polygon network to Metamask which was way cheaper then USDC ERC20 $15 fee plus eth gas. Then used Curve Pool to swap POS USDC to AxlUSDC. (so cheap)  Then used satellite to bring axlUSDC to Osmosis. $1.50 I think. All told, I got it done for $2 total if memory serves.

"Summary of Alpha Venture DAO's interview with Sei Network's Head of Ecosystem.","ReveloIntel","2022-12-08 03:25:38"," 

In this episode of [Alpha Venture DAO](https://twitter.com/AlphaVentureDAO) on ‚ÄòBuilding the Perfect DEX app with Sei, the New L1 Optimized for DeFi‚Äô with our special guest, [Dan Edlebeck](https://twitter.com/deeeedle), Head of Ecosystem at [Sei](https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork).

**Intro to Alpha Academy &amp; Guest Speaker**

* Dan has been involved in crypto since 2017 and worked in the non-profit space before that.
* Moved to Costa Rica and helped the community build 17 different businesses.
* Started a crypto marketing company that helped projects to better market their position.
* Founded Insidio in 2020, a company building on Sentinel (p2p network for bandwidth on Cosmos blockchain).

**What Is Sei** 

* Sei is the first sector-specific layer on a blockchain focused on trading and DeFi.
* Jay and Jeff, founders of Sei wanted to build a perpetual protocol and decided to build a sector-specific blockchain.
* Sei serves as an infrastructure layer for the future of the entire financial system and is focusing on exchanges now.

**What Makes Sei the Best Place to Build Defi Projects**

* Sei is a Layer 1 focused on the needs of exchanges that is optimized for latency and has shorter block times.
* In Sei Test net funds are settled in a 600-millisecond block time, this helps DeFi to match the trading experience on a centralized exchange.
* Order Batch Auctioning ensures user orders are not being front-run.

**Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) vs Automated Market Maker (AMM)**

* CLOB orders are aggregated to match buyers with sellers.
* For a perpetual protocol, an order book with a built-in order-matching engine makes a lot of sense.
* Any exchange could use the Sei Infrastructure to execute on the blockchain in a short amount of time.

**How You Can Engage With Sei; Atlantis, International Growth Program**

* Follow [Sei Network](http://twitter.com/SeiNetwork) on Twitter to learn more about what Sei is optimizing and what makes them unique.
* Join the [Sei Discord ](https://discord.com/invite/Sei)community to join thousands of users and ways to connect with the team.
* Atlantis is an international growth program that is focused on helping us to spread the message about Sei. A full-time role is available if tasks are completed and if the user proves to be a strong contributor.

**Sei in Bear Market and the Protocol Status**

* FTX debacle has shown that building DeFi is the way to go and it is important to build a great DeFi user experience.
* Sei Labs is well-capitalized and has a $50m ecosystem fund.

**Sei Roadmap and the Future of Web 3.0 With Sei**

* Sei is gearing up to stress test and audit the blockchain so it can be live in production soon.
* Protocols are starting to deploy on the Sei test net.
* Users can participate on the [Seinami test net](https://3pgv.notion.site/All-Seinami-Testnet-Missions-16c0a40320244c24b0bc3f663c0cf00b) to earn $SEI tokens.
* Users could be leveraging exchanges built on top of DeFi in the near future.

**Key Thing That Makes Sei Successful**

* Sei has a really great engineering team to build a sector-specific chain on Cosmos SDK.

**Advice to Founders**

* SBF has hurt crypto deeply.
* Founders should double down on building DeFi as there are plenty of opportunities.

"Thoughts on EVMOS?","justvims","2022-12-08 02:20:00","Is this more or less headed the way of a rug? Seems like there was a big private sale and now a dump. Or am I misreading this?","19","[""Define rug\n\nIt‚Äôs definitely a ‚Äúneeded‚Äù platform with a strong team. The devs on evmos aren‚Äôt running away with your money."",""It‚Äôs an EVM in Cosmos. If you believe in Cosmos at all, then it would be logical to assume that a Cosmos EVM would be populated with tons of projects in the future. \n\nEvmos has a quality team behind it and it has only been out about 6 months. Finding projects with potential that were released during the bear market will be key to making a good return during the next bull market. Anyone can bet on a blue chip. Those people won‚Äôt make as much as those that find the hidden gems that no one believed in during the bear market. \n\nDiffusion for instance‚Ä¶ 350M coins total. At $1, Diff would have a 350M market cap. That seems pretty achievable. Right now, it‚Äôs at $.004. Those that buy in the bull will pay a premium for what they could have gotten at $.004 in the bear when there was fear and doubt about its potential. As the number one DEX on Evmos (at the moment, anyway), if Evmos takes off, how much do you think the DEX will be worth? How much money will pass through it? Yes, it‚Äôs a gamble, but so are all crypto projects (like FTT). Those that take the gamble based on an educated decision will have decent odds of being winners. Just don‚Äôt put all of your money in one basket. \n\nDisclaimer: don‚Äôt buy anything based on my opinion. Educate yourself and make an informed choice. If you don‚Äôt believe in a platform, there‚Äôs no shame in moving on. Evmos isn‚Äôt guaranteed, but to me, there are good odds of it being successful. I‚Äôm playing the odds."",""honestly i think it also has alot to do with the APR% come down so much, i remember being so bullish on Evmos with MANY others when it was paying like 600-700% APR , we all thought we hit the gravy train.. and we did, but you would of have to be cashing out and converting those rewards into fiat to actually be \"" up \"" on evmos right now... i Sold all my Evmos around 2$ when i seen APR coming down fast below 300% , Combine this with the markets and we are in bear market after all + alot of Validators actually been selling rewards, the sell pressure probably got very high the past few days and so im not surprised in this drop.\n\ni bought some Evmos at around 1.20$ and ill buy it again today.  i have a Brick of cash just sitting on the side since i havn't been putting it on my ledger every week like i used to.  im ready to put it a big amount of money, But Market sentiment is saying  we are just not ready..... yet..."",""The lockup period on unstaking has a wierd delay on price action, as well as the high Apr.\n\nIf you had interest in evmos at $2 why do you not at 0.50?\n\nMany cosmos projects have had smaller drops than most it can't last forever in a bear market."",""[removed]"",""Those APRs are unsustainable. Simple. My simple brain still got sucked in with a lack of foresight, but it's a small stack for me so I'm cool with it"",""Price action wise, I always thought it will dump once the APR goes down, like any other high APR projects. Unstaked half a few months ago to sell.\n\nProject wise, it's a good project imo I'm still holding and staking."",""Apr was high, bear market striked hard again. That pretty much sums it up. Plus half of the promised dapp didn't launch and the ones that did some are still buggy, underdeveloped."",""Evmoswap requires support from Evmos. Thanks."",""your head is on right for being skeptical, some smaller will tokens crash and never really recover."",""Well it's seems as though EVMOS is headed to zero. I certainly don't want that! \n\nIn all seriousness though I still think EVMOS will be around when ATOM is over $20 again. Then I see EVMOS rising to around the $5 - $7 mark at that point. \n\nCrypto Markets are not doing well right now and we can see this every week we check our portfolios just to see that they are down.\n\nEVMOS was a gift for a lot of us here in terms of the Airdrop. I'm not one who complains about receiving free money. Be it $5 or $15,000 (at one point my Crescent Airdrop was worth 15K) and I thought about unstaking all my EVMOS last week but did not do it. It will turn around when positive, buying \nexuberance returns to the Crypto Markets. A lot of factors play a key role in when and how it will happen.\n\nTo anyone who bought into EVMOS with Fiat my advice is to keep staking your main bag and convert the daily rewards to a top coin in the Ecosystem, like ATOM OSMO JUNO SCRT STRD pretty much every day. \n\nThis year started out so great as crypto was flying, but it moved so fast that the only other way it could go was down. Things broke and failed. LUNA for example FTX and I know that there are plenty of other horror stories from this year in Crypto. \n\nWith the ongoing War with Russia and The Ukraine and the crazyness happening in China with the protestors and RIOT police over COVID-19 lock down and shit here in the US has to be going well."",""I get that rug feeling. I'm hopfully it will turn around or at least find a bottom. Thinking in a month it'll be $.003. When it happened to me with Luna, I swore to myself that I wouldn't let it happen to me again. I put most of my focus on Bitcoin and Eth, increasing my holdings in them,  at least until the market turns. Then along come Evmos, I liked what I saw and took a chance. I'm down 78% and so mad at myself. I've unbonded half of my holdings, I have 2 more weeks until those are freed up. The rest I'll be holding and hoping for the best."",""Seems like a good prohect to me, but happy to have sold 2/3 of mine on the eay down; market cap was far too high considering how early days it was.\n\nWill consider further investment before next bull market‚Ä¶"",""Having got in early on Evmos, I was able to acquire a decent sized bag and pump some of my other bags too with the proceeds, but realistically I know I'm not the only person who did this and it's perfectly logical that price action has been what it has been.  As long as people keep building on it I think the project has legs in the future, but man is it ever taking a beating in the short term."",""I just got into the Cosmos ecosystem and kid you not ATOM and most of its microcoins are gems. I just put about $200 into evmos and yes It dipped around $60 immediately BUT longterm holdings will outweigh these short term dips. Everything if not most is bear market and these are golden opportunities to scatter investments around and continue to buy on dips. Compound and buy ins at lower prices will FARRRR OUTWEIGH short term losses.""]"

"What is coming to Secret Network?","AnewbiZ_","2022-12-07 21:02:13","With the upcoming Shockwave Omega upgrade only 1 week away,  I want to get the discussing going.

SCRT is positioning in way that will allow the app chain thesis to flourish. In Cosmos we have specialized chains that are sovereign, yet interoperable. 

Some have specialized more than others. For example Osmosis has kept the chain very focused on DEX utility.  And SCRT had focused on privacy. While others have gone for generalizrd platforms.

In my opinion, the chains specializing will gain more long term value since it addresses the underlining fundamental scaling issue that blockchain technology faces.  
Where chains which are attempting to do all things, will find the same bottlenecks that we have seen in other networks so often.

During the Shockwave Delta upgrade, the Secret Network enabled interchain contracts which opened the door to interoperability previously unseen.

Interchain contracts enable a chain to share these specialties ""as a service"".

This is one of the most powerful utility values for SCRT in the appchain thesis.  Privacy as a Service.
This utility allows any Cosmos chain to leverage the security of user privacy, from Secret by using interchain contracts. 

With the Omega upgrade, there are several updates such as the programing language, and performance enhancements. But perhaps more importantly, it is setting the stage for the SCRT2.0 development. 

SCRT 2.0 will push the interchain contract thesis to new limits, it expands into a constellation of privacy preserving technologies. 

Adding specializations to the existing SGX chains own. 

Each encryption method has it's pros and cons, speed, strength, and cost. Non has all of this things, you can only choose 2. 

But what if you could blend 2 different encryption methods?  This could allow you to harden the 1st encryptions method against it's shortfalls.

Or what if you need only one and not the other?

Choose whichever you wish, and leave the ithers to those who need it. 

Currently we have chains building on a single thesis and trying to force it to cover all of the bases. 

Quite simply, it will never work. 

SGX will never cover all bases. 

Zero Kowledge or ZK technology will never cover all bases. 

MPC or FHE will not either. 

Each is great for its purpose and there is a place for each, so why not make them available, then include them to an interoperable platform like IBC interchain contracts?

That is exactly what is about to happen!

This next year,  while the markets fall, and the bears feast.üêª SCRT will build, and innovate. 

And when the builders come, we will be here to offer privacy as a service. Let the other chains build their specialty, then leverage ours as well. üî•
